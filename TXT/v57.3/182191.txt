As shown in thc previous studies,i) the presentauthor has proposed and veri'ficd thc

From thc cxamination of "the Five Chapters" vvre can recognizc the deep considcration of thc compilers of theSuv towardthcmembers ofroyal families.From thisconsideration theyhavesuc-

Buddhism had once stood fbresnositnthe religious world of Indiaunder the patronage of the
greatkingssuch asKingASokaoftheMauryaEmpireorKingKaniskaoftheKushanEmpirc.
However duringand after theGuptaperiodwhen theSuvwas compi]ed. Buddhism hasbeenal-

by obtaining various kinds of aid of the kings as well as of their people,must have attempted to surN'ive inthe religious world forthe salce ofaccomplishing the dutiesofthe Buddhist clergy.

3.The Path to the Attainment of Supreme Enlightenment Represented inthe Susambhava-IJarivarta

4.Conclusion
By the discouTseof the SusaTnbhava:parivartahe, compilers of thc Suv attempts to
encourage laypeople,especially kingsor therich,who are desirousof attaining supermun-
danemerits tomake ofTbrings ofriches nottothestfipasoftheBuddhaSakyamunbiut,to
thepreacherso'ftheSuvand theassemblies towhich thepreachersoftheS"vbelong.We
can fairlyswppose at leastwo backgroundsto thisattempt: one istheintentioonfthe Ma-
hayanamovement to shift the central focusof Buddhism from stapa to dharrnaa,nd the
other is,as hasbeendiscusseidnthepreviousstudies, thewish of thecompilers o'ftheSav
to survive inthercligious world fbrthesake of accornplishing the duticsof the Buddbist
clergy byobtaining financiaildfromlaypeople.Whereasthereligious merits aimed atin
ttthe
Five Chapters" and the Devencb"asamqya:parivarta, which are the successive six
chapters and located beforethisSusaipabhava-parivarta,re mainly the mundane ones, just
tbose aimed at in this chapter are supermundane oncs. Thcrefbre by tcaching those dis- courses of thcsesuccessive seven chapters ("thFeiveChapters,t"heDevendi"asamayaparivarta, and the Stisaqibhava-parivarta,)the compilers of theSuv become able to expect the offerings not only from the people who want to attain mundane merits, butalse fromthosewho want supermundane merits.24) Since those offerings are not "the offerings to the Buddha," the Buddhist monks can utilize them fbrthe sake of accomplishing their transmission of the Law and religious practiceforsupreme enlightenment.
Wecan thussay thatthepurposeofthisshortpaperwas achieved inthatthevalidityof <theHypothesis>hasbeeneven more strengthened.
