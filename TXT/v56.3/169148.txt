3.2 As [[Songkha pa understands it,the PrEsafigikaschool holdsthe view that thepast isthe effective thingwhich isproducddby itscause, and which ceases to exist after hav- ingproduceditseffbct.[[bexplain: a sprout's state ofhaving ceased (nzygu zhigpa) arises when the sprout has ceased to exist; and itceases to exist, bringingabout another state ef havingceased (nopg?uulhigpa zhigpa); theproductionof thestate ofhaving ceased occurs ina sequence.
