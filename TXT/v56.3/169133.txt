TheSignificancofethe Thirty-twoLakkhaipasofa Buddha
NiTiA Tomomichi
Some scholars haveoften brushedoff theissueof theorigin of Buddha'sthirty-two
lakkha4as(Skita.ksana,bodilyrnarks) byattributing them tothedeificatiofntheBuddha
Gotama.i)However, a few have expressed the view thatheyfunetioinnsome MahayEna
sutras as objects of observation when people meditate on a Buddha.2> According to
Swearer modern Theravfidinalsso use theseinthisway as well. Inhisstudy on (2002),
the eeremony fbrtheconsecration of Buddha imagesinthemodern Theravada traditionof SoutheastAsia,hehasclarified thatthethirty-twelakkhanasof a Buddhaimageare cor- related with the thirty-two meditation objects (kommatthfintai)heceremony.3) Moreover, although themeditation on a Buddha'sphysicalfbrmishardlyever found inold Hinayana
texts,we can discovear few sentences, which mention itinthe Chinese Agamas.4>
Of course, thereisnot enough evidence to provethata Buddha'slajlkhanahsavebeen
used as meditation objects from the very begirmingof their introductiointoBuddhism. However, thereseems littldeoubtthattheyhavebeenutilized insuch away inMahdyana and lateHinaydriaBuddhism.Ifthatisthecase, we ought tothink'thattheywere not mere
meaningless "adornments" to make the "historical Buddha" intoa supei`h,uman, butinstead have some sort of symbolic rneaning right from the start, which eventually made the iakL
kha4asbeeome objects of meditation lateron.

First,theunderstanding thatthe thirty-twolalckharpacsome

inthecase of a "Great Man," hiswhole bodyisas perfectas a lien'tsorso."i4)Follow- ingthisi,tstates thata Buddha's bedyisfreefromimperfectionansd thereason forthisis shown by a citation, which seems to be a partofa sutra, as fo11ows:
When a resuit of a good deedarises, partsof thebodywhich lookbeautifub1ybeinglongbecome !ong.Partsof thebedywhich lookbeautifub1y beingshort become short..Parts of thebodywhich lookbeairtifbuy[beingthick become thickP.artsof thebody which tookbeautifub1y beingthin becomethin.Partsef thebodyWhichlookbeautifu1bybeingfiatbecomefiat.Partsof thebody which lookbeautilibJylbeing round become round.15)
In this way, according to the MPA, a Buddha obtains "the body likea lion'tsorso" be- cause ofhis previousgooddeeds.
We can a]so confirm inthe sarne textanother meaning of the lakkha4ast,hatis,they are able to remove doubtsand provoke faithin a Buddha. This attribute can be fbund in the explanation for"the Iargetongue" where itstates that:

Now, itmight be considered to be a matter of ceurse that these two interpretatiofns the Zakkharpansam,ely thattheyare theresults ofgood deedsina Buddha'spreviouslives and thattheyremove doubtsand provoke faitihna Buddha,can also befoundintheMPA, as the PaliNik5yas and others havealready presentedthem.
