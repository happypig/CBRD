sidered as an utter violence of therule of Buddhistsociety 3).Thiscustorn isnot fbundin

avoid thisort ofmarriage tie.
Some pepularnotions are also observed bytheBamas duringthemaniage ceremony. For
example, themarriage ceremony isnot heldon thebirthdaoyf thebridegroomor thebride. Theybelievethatifmarriageceremony isheldon thebinhdaybringsabout unhappiness in thecoajugal lifeof the couple. Besides,inthe month of Kanika,Paus, and CaitraofBen- galicalendar usually no maniage isheld.Thatis,ifany marriage isheldinthemonth of KartikaofBengali calendar, thenew bridewill need a lotof attention and special care, in the same way as an elephant needs a lotofnutrition and vegetation, and themonth ofPaus
and Caitram,arriage ceremenies will bringevil results. Thesebeliefaslso prevailinthe Hindnsociety, butnot inMuslims 5).For a suitable match, bothpaniesconsult horoscopes
