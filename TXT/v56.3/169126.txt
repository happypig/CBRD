O.Introduction
Itiscommonly argued thattheuse of "impurities" such as liquorand meat isone of thedistincticvhearacteristics ofHindu Tantrism.In contrast to asceticlorthodQx Hindn- ism which ayoids such "impurities", Ihntrismoften attempts toaccomplish religious goals throughtheemployment of them.Goudriaan describetdhisas fo11ows:

On the other hand, for the appeasement of ancestors, spirits, or demons,theoffering of liquorismentioned ina nurnber of Post Vedic scriptures, such as the Gr.hyasUtraFso.r ex-
ample, Vinayaka,who possessesand impairshumans,accepts liquoras an offering: "[He
should offeT] a variegated, firagrafnitowerand threetypes ofsunli as well (VZijfiavalftlyasmrt [YS]1.288)7)".TheA-SvaldyanagrhyastiItIr5a.3-5etc.mentions theofferingofsura to
one's femaleancestors 8). Moreover,inthe47thchapter of theBrhatsamhita[BS]9),on
the royal abtution on the day ofpusya, we can observe demons as daitya,and (such pMca,
danava)who are worshiped with liquor<BS47.27-31).To sum up, we can say thatinthe context of orthodox Hinduism,offerings of liquorare "used fbrtheworship of an unusual
divinityor,a demonicbeingiO)". We should also pay attention tothefacthatofTerings of liquorare foundincontexts quiteunrelated tothe avoidance of drinkingH.owever,italso seems clear thathereisa consistency betweenthe Brahmin's taboo on drinkinlgiquorand theofferingof]iquortoademonic,awfu1 being:bothrulescou]d beinterpreteadsintene- ingtopreservepurity,and keepaway impurity.

Itisclear fromwhat we have seen thatthe drinkingand offering ofliquor are regarded as a series ofpractices forattaining liberation.
