chaos, and Buddhistmonasteries were plunderedafter northern SriLanka came under the rule ofthe Co!as.Latef,theSihalakingVijayabahuI(I055--11d1r0o)veout theColaarmy,

In this article, the credibility of the infbrmation intheCv. on the extermina- provided
tion ef the Damilas isconsidered by examining the infiuxof the Dam.ilasintothe island, using chiefly epigraphical records befbreand after thebattlbeetweenVijayabahuI and the
Damilas.Examplesfromother partsoftheCv.oftheprotectionofBrahrnansbythecourt of SriLanka are also taken intoaccount.
2. The Accounts in the Cv. Regarding the lnvasion of the Co!as

the lands they owned were termed Demeldi ktibb'lla
and Demeg gambim (Tamivil11ages and ]ands).3D)Theinscriptionaslso referred toDemeldadhikfiri, aDarnilasuperintendent
of the landthat was allocated to the Damila mercenaries.3i) Based on therecords of the distributioofnthe landsthatthe Damilas occupied, itcan bepresimiedthatthey livedin scattered settlements, centering around the northern and eastern partsofthe island.
Epigraphicalrecords aiso show theexistence oftheDamilasintheislandinthePolon- naruva period.According to the slab-inscription foundinPolonna[ruvtah,e troops of the

4.TheProtectionProvidedbytheSihalaKingstotheBrahmans on theIsland
AccountsintheMahavampsa datingbacktotheAnurEdhapura say that (Mhv.) period
theSihalaroyal familiehsadlentsupport totheBrahrnansi,nspite of Buddhismbeingthe national religioll inSriLanka. This custom didnot change inthePolonnaruva period.Even VijayabaliIu,who recaptured powerfromtheColasand was thenenthroned atPolonnaru- va, didnot support the pcrsecutionofHinduism. He didnot remove anything thathad been contributed to thevarious shrines tillthattime.4i) Itappears thata largenumber of Brah- mans visited SriLanka duringthe course of the rule of the Colas,and itispresumedthat they'were permanent residents of at leastKantalay or the surrounding villagcs under the reign ofVljayabaliu I.AccofdingtotheTletmislab-inscriptions discoveredat PEIamOttai which datebacktotheforty-second ofVijayabahu I'sreign, therewas a shrine of

Sivtahatwas named after Vljayaraja-igvaram,as hehadsupported it42)Furthert,heplace
where the Brahmans had settled was known as Vijayaraja-caturyedi-mafigalam,43an)d Kantalay,locatedintheTrincomaleedistricintthenortheast partsof SriLanka,became
thevillage where theylived.44)
Brahmans were also ermployed inthecourt duringthePolonnaruva and they period, pe-
formedtherites ofpassage forthe Sihalakings.Aceording to the Cv.,when Mzan5bhara4a asked apurohita the meaning ofhis dream,thepurohitapredictedthebirthof a princewith marks of good fortune.4S5u}ch a son was borrto Mantibhararpanad latergrew up to be KingParakamabahu I(1153-1186th)egreatestheroinSriLanka,who unified allthepolit-

All of these rituals were solemnly conducted by the Brahmans, who were thor- prince.49)
oughly conversant with the ritual performancesof the Veda.50)After Paraklcamabahu ascended thethrone,he,too,supported Hinduism.InRajaratLha, hebuilthirteenshrines5D and renovated seventy-nine dilapidatesdhrines;52)inRoharpa,herestored twenty-fbur shines as well.53) He also builta Hemarnandira and a Dhdrarpigharfaorthe Brahmans to perfbrmrituals and recite spells.54) Brahmans who wandered and beggedalse existed dur- inghisreign. 55)
Theseexamples intheCv.reveal thattheVedicceremonies were performedinSriLanka and thattheBrahmans were highlyrespected bythecourt society despittehecourt's politi- cal opposition toDamilas.Thus,altheugh theSihalasfbughtfiercbeattlewsith theDami-

5.・Conclusio"
As considered above, itisconfirmed thatfromthelateAnuradhapuraperiod,Darnilas settled on the island,and even after the victory of Vijayab2huI against the Colas,they eontinued to liveon the islanduringthe Polonnaruva period.Therefore,itisclear that VijayabahuI'sbaulesagainst theCo!aswere not foughtwith thern becausetheywere of theDamilarace. Thus,thestatement intherock-inscriptien discovereidnAiiibagamuva in
56) thereign ofVljayab5hu I,"he droveavvay wholly thedarknessofTamil fbrces," i.e.h,e
droveaway thedarknessofthe Tamil (Colam)ilitaryap,tly describetshiscase.
Attentionshould bc to the thathe expressions paid possibility
Sihalasover the Damilas harvebeen exaggerated by the compilers
of of the predominance
of the Cv.; these exag- geratedexpressions implythathe kingsof SriLankashould beseen as heroeswho gained
absolute victories against the enernies who threatened the stability ofpolitical situations and against thewell-being ofBuddhism.
