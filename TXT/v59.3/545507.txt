Ifthismodel ofthe

used? Inmost cases, thisquestionmay not so readily arise, sincc the visual model isso

and metaphors are donethrough visual imagery,with thc mirror and itsreflec- planations
tions beingthe preeminent trope. But what about sound, odor, taste,and tactilesensation? How dowe describethese,or trytomake them work through thesarne paradigm?
Here,we can see some wisdom inXuanzang's choice of the compound word of ]iSptto render bimba,which, unlike itsSanskritcounterpart, hasno reference toimagery,butliter-
