Thismeans that after ignoringthe 7laishoc-ollations with the Old Sbng lspart, the con-
tentsof the161collations in7Ziishoar-e identicaltothecounterpart contents thatfbundin lbkyoEdition.Combiningthe161collations fromGroupBand the14collations from
GroupA as mentioned above, there are a totalof 175collations thatare identicalbetween the two editions of 7bisho'and 7bdyo. In other words, ifwe remove the collations from the Old-Sbng, out ofthe 200 collations in 7laishO,175 collations are identicalto the ones found
in 7bkyo Edition,which means 85%; almost 90% ofthe collations are consistent with each other betweenthesetwo versions.

Ifwe leaveaside the aforementioned 175 identicalcollations, there are the other 25 col- lationswhich are inconsistentwith each other between7bishoa-nd 7bdyoEditionW.ithin the25 collations, thereare 9 mistaken collations fbund,where 7laisho" thecollations

7bkyo Edition,the editor of 7laish6didnot proofreadthe cellations one by one. However,
from 7bkyo Edition.In any event, the editor of 7inisho- quoted
lyfrom7bdyoEditionand didnot carefu11y check theerrors there.As a result, 7bishjad- opted 9 collation errers which are the original mistakes ofthe 7lokyoEdition.
