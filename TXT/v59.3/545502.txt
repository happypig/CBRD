Ishall consider thesepointsagain, butfirsatnother analysis ofthe divisioonf theargument must beexamined.
2.Tosaki analyses the argument invv. 11-50into7 sections with 7 reasons fbrthe non-ex- istencoef the universal.4) Hisanalysis differisntwo respects fromthatwhich Ihavepro- posed.Firstlyh,eanalyses vv. 11-40 as comprising threeseparate arguments with three
differenrteasons. The three reasons are: (a)that the universal isthe object of the word (vv.11-24),(b)thattheuniversal cannot beexpressed as identicawlith or differentfrom
theindividua(lvv.25-38),and (c)thattheuniversal istheobject ofa cognition of the
kindas that of an absence5) (vv.39-40).Secondly, in vv. 48-50 he findstwo argu-
same ments
(e) Hisdivisioinstheresultofhiseffbrttorefiect theseven characteristicsoftheuniversal
with two differenretasons, namely (d)that the form ofthe uniyersal initscogriition (vv4.8"9), and thatthe universal lackseMcacity 50).
(v. suggested by Devendrabuddhi and Manorathanandin.6)Intheircomments on v. 5lab,the
pear
verse which says thatthe
isthatwhich iscontrary to the [universasle]x- particular
they enumerate the seven characteristics of the plained,
as the opposites ofthose particular
ofthe universal statedintheprecedingdiscussion.M7a)norathanandin furtheardds thatthe characteristics of the universal that are opposite to those of the particularserve [inDhar- makirti's discussiont]o establish the non-existence of the universal.8) Itisnot wrong to count these characteristics inDharrnakirti'asrgument as those of the universal and to un- derstandthem to be serving insome way as the reasons fbrasserting the non-existence of the universal; butto understand the context by dividingthe argument according tothese seven pointsisdebatable;9fb)r,as we shall see, of thesesome of thesecharacteristics are not tmly distincFtu.rthermore,when we understand the argument thus,the meaning ofthe fourcriteria shown inthe beginning ofthe argument blurs. 3.Inbrieftheproblemsthatarise individingvv. 11-50according totheseven characteris- ticsofthe universal are as fbllowsF.irstT,osakianalysed vv. 48-50 as comprising (d)and (e,)butsince the claim of (e)isbased on that of (d,)these verses are betterconstrued as a single continuous argument. IO) The subject there isthat the universal isnon-existent be- cause ithas no eMcacity, which then corresponds to the firsctriterion of the four.(See

section 1 above.) The same holdsfbrvv. 11-40: (a)vv. 11-24, (c)vv. 39-40, and also vv. 34-38,which are includedin(b)inTosaki'sdivisionc,an beconsidered tohavethe same subject. The subject thereisthattheuniversal isnon-existent becauseitisthe object ofthe word,ii) which corresponds to the third criterion.
Itistrue,however,thatwithin vv. 11-40,vv. 25-33 are discussingsomething diffbrent. Inthe beginningof thissection, invv. 25-27b,Dharmakirtiargues thata universal isnon- existent because itcan neither be identicawilth nor differentfrom an individualT.his rea- soning fbrthe non-existence ofthe universal differfsrom thatwhich we haveseen above in vv. 11-24and 34--40B.utwe see almost thesame reasoning appearing again invv. 41-44 inthe argument forthe same claim. The differencbeetweenthe two sets of arguments is that Dhamiakirti presentsvv. 41-44 more clearly as corresponding to the second criterion fbrdistinguishitnhge two kinds of object.L2) Moreover, after vv. 25-27b, from v. 34 on,
the argument forthenon-existence of theuniversal fremthefactthatitisthe object ofa word rcsumes. Itwould therefbrebebettertotakcvv.25-33asderivativearguments ap-
pearing inthe serics of argumcnts corresponding to the third criterion. Verses 28-33 ex- plainwhat the universal is:the universal, which has been demonstrated in vv. 25-27b to haveno nature, isstated inv. 28tobejusttheresult ofconceptual construction; and v. 29 states that itisan error to think that the universal has itsown nature or that a thing is [iden- ticalwith] it.Thus,thearguments invv. 25-33arc claiming thattheuniversal doesnot ex- istand thattothinkthatitdoesismistaken. Thisargument must havebeeninspirebdythe preceding arguments, those in vv. 19-24, which criticise the doctrineof the Brahmanical realists thatexistent universals are theobject ofwords.i3)
4.IntheprevjoussectionsIhave proposedtodividetheargument intovv. 11-40,41-44, and 48 -50, and shown that each corresponds to one of the criteria. Verses 45-47, which havenot beenmentioned above, explain thatthecognition of theuniversal arises indepen- dence on verbal cenvention, or, when the cognition isnot accompanicd by a word, the proximitybetween the things. Thus vv. 45-47 claim that the cognition of the universal arises fromcauses other thantheuniversal itselaLnd so correspond tothefburthcriterion.
Thuswe can see theargument invv. 11-50as provingtheuniversal's beingnon-existent
on the basisof itsother fburcharacteristics indicatedinthe fourcriteria. We can under- stand thatDharmakirti'sargument serves toattack thedoctrineof thoserealistswho hold thattheuniversal exists,i4) as well as topromotehisown theory.Itwould beusefu1, inor-

dertounderstand thecharacteristics ofthis argument, toconsider howitappears when we see that itiscriticism ofthe realists' position.
5.As we haveseen, thecharacteristics ofthe universal discusseidnthefirsttwo arguments, invv. 11-40 and vv. 41-44, are itsbeing the object of the word and itsbeing common. Theseare thecharacteristics ofthe universal accepted bothbyDharmakirtiand bythereal- istsB.ut thefbrmerfoundthem incompatiblweith the additional characteristic ascribed to universals bythelattern,amely theirbeingexistent: invv. 11-40hedemonstratetshecon- tradictionsthatarise iftheobject of veifbal cognition isreal, and, invv. 41-44,thatcom- monality, ifitexisted, could haveno relation with indiyiduals.
On the other hand, the characteristics that Dharmakirtiascribes to the universal invv. 45-50 are thosethattherealists would not accept. He states invv. 45-47 thatthe cognition
of the universal arises fromother causes itselfl,anidnvv. thatthe [than 48-50
universal isneverseenandsohasnoefficacity.Thesearguments canbeseentosharethesame basic
yiew against the realists' positionthattheuniversal produces itsown cognition. Using
Dharmakirti'sown terms,we may say thatheisrefuting therealists' view thatheuniver-
sal haseMcacity.
6.Inshort, invv. 11-50 Dharmakirtiiscriticising the view thatthe universal, which isthe
object ofthe word, exists and has eMcacity. For him thereal isthe efficacious, and by this
criterion only the Itwas necessary forhim, inorder to distinguish particularqualifies.i5)

11-50can thereforebesaid tosupport histheoryof thedistinctiobnetweenthetwokinds ofobject.
