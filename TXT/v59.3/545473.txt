Itshould beasked herewhy GafigeSadidnot reject 6c (speaker's We can
couiecture as fo11owsW.hile Udayana seems to clearly set Mimamsakas as the opponents throughout hisargument, the figureof the epponent isnot explicit inthc prcsentsection of TC. The context ofTC doesnot fbrceGafigeSato employ thedialectictaelchniqueUdaya- na resorts to. Perhaps on this account he does not fbllowthe strategy of the predecessor and adopts 6c as hisconclusivc view.
Afterthus settling the nature of thiparya, GafigeSasserts that the Veda has the author on thesame groundas thatof Udayanaand thenbeginstheextensive discussionosn scrip- tures.
Conclusion
We have seen above the close resemblance of GafigeSa'sargumcnts on taipaTya to that ef Udayana. Bothof them use the conclusion of the argument fbrthe purposeof establish-
ingtheexistence ofthe author ofthe Veda.Thecontent oftheir arguments also shows similarities. Based on this comparative investigatiwoen,may safely say that Gahgega'sar- gument on taipar:yaislargelymodeled on thatof Udayana. We havethusobtained another
of cvidence that shows the influenceof Udayana, of his NKus, on the piece particularly
fbrmationof GafigeSa'lsinguistitcheories.9)
Theclose connection betweenGafigegaand Udayana would warrant reading Gafigega's
