1.The Aim of This Paper: A Continuous Verificationof the Hypothesis
1) Thepresentauthor hasproposedand verified thefbllowinghypothesis about theinten-
tions ofthe compilers ofthc Suvar4aprabhasa Light;Suv)2) : (SfitorfaGolden
<TheHypothesis> Owing to the account of the Suv which has, through the several stages of its formationc,ollected and demonstratetdhevarious kindsofdoctrines and riteaslready expounded in other treatisest,hecompilers and theproponentsofthe Suvbecamemore able toleadtheirdailyre- ligiouslivesinaccordance with LLthe teaching of [Mah5yanaB]uddhism." We can therefbreintcr- pretthe featuresappearing inthe Suv not as a token of "the assirnilation of Buddhism intoHindu- ism" or "the depravityofBuddhism," butas an attempt of Buddhists to survive inthe Indian religious world by emphasizing the value, the usefulness, and the completeness of [Mahayana] Buddhismunder thecircumstances where Hinduismhadbecomemore and more dominantover Buddhism (durinangd aftertheGuptaperiod.)Moreever,ifoneof theintentionosfthe compilers efthe S"vlayinthisattempt bycollecting as many doctrineasnd riteas possiblefromthestage of thc formationof the Suvcjtothatof theS"vc.c,onsistently, we can suppose thattheintentionfthe compilers remained unchanged all through the stages of the formationef the Suv. Furthermorei,t may turnout thattheS"v isnot "a mere miscellaneous medley of doctrineasnd rites," buta coltec- tionofthem which isintrinsitco the value of the Suv.
Suzuki[2010]hasprovidedthe most recent study on thissubject, and the fbllowing tentativeconclusion hasbeen reached:
Buddhism had once stood foTemostinthe religious world of Indiaunder the patronage of the greatkingssuch as King Asiokaof the Maurya Empire and King Kaniskaof the Kushan Empire. However duringand after the Gupta periodwhen the Suv was compiled, Buddhism had already lost itsdominant to Hinduism.

of the Suv succeeded in introducingthose featurewsithout havingdisturbetdhc traditional ideaor deviatedfromtheorthodox formulaofBuddhism sincetheattainrnentofsupreme enlightenment by theBuddha S5kyamuniis,inaccordance with theBuddhisttradition,inseparablylinkedtothewel- fareof all scntient beingsinthe Suv. Here may lieone of the reasons why theSuv hasremaincd a Buddhistscripture through allthestages of itsfbrmationand transmission, howevermuch thecom-
of the Suv emphasized thc attainment of mundane merits, and however many featuretshey pilers
introducedintothe Suv which had been rather unusual fbrthe Buddhist scriptures at that time.

Iflaypeoplewant toobtain various kindsofmundane merits byhearingh,onoring,and

7)
where the monks reside who hold and preachthe S"v, and ask the monks to preach the
Suv or to exhibit the copies of the Suv. Naturally enough, there can take place the ex- change ofpreaching the Suv or the exhibition of the Suv (fromthe monks to the laypee-
ple)fbrofferings (fromthelaypeopletothemonks), and theseofferings will support as financialaid the religious practicesand the liyesefthe monks.
1fosum up,
(1)The compilers ofthe Suv attempt to emphasize the value ofthe Suv byrepeating thattheSuv is excellent, profound,and diMculttoobtain.
(2)The chief ways to obtain various kinds of merits are the hearingof the Suv, and so en. No severe practicepeculiarto monks isrequired.
(3)Almost all the merits to be ebtained are not supermundane butmundane ones.
(4)From (2)and (3),thecarcrsofthc Suvare supposcd tobelaypeople.
(5)Jflaypeoplewant tohearthepreciousS"v,theymust ask thosemonks who holdtheSuvto
preachit.In that case there will naturally take placethe exchange of preachingtheSuv (from themonks tothelaypeople)forofferings (fi'tohmelaypeopletothemonks).
These fivepointshave been made clear. As has been shown in the previous studies,8) these characteristics are also shared by other chapters intheSuv.Therefbreitfbllowswhat hasbeensaid thattheintentioonf thecompilers of theSuvthat"undcr circumstances where Buddhism had already lostitsdominantpositionto Hinduism, the compilers of the Suv,byobtaining various kindsof aid from laypeople,must have atternpted to survive in thereligious world fbrthesake of accomplishing the dutiesof theBuddhistclergy" isa]so expressed inthe Nidana:parivarta which hasbecn locatedat the beginningof the Suv throughout thestages of itsfbrmationW.e can say thatthisfactalso the

compilers of theSuvattempted toemphasize itscompleteness."
Comparing the differencebsetweenthe accounts inthefirsstage and those inthe second
stage, we can notice that the chief aim of the enlaTgement of the NidZina-parivartaliesin formingthe Suv more properlyas stitra literaturrea,ther than ineTrriching itscontent. This supports theideaabove mentioned that"the compilers of theSuvattempted toemphasize itscompleteness."
3.2.2T.he Origin of the Enlarged Part
As faras Iknow. there exists only one Buddhistscripture thathasa similar structure and
content totheenlarged partinChapter1oftheSuv.ItistheMahameghastitra(MMS).9) Theenlarged partintheNidZina-zparivaorfthae Suv(Suvn185.1-189.31S,"vc3403a7- 404a3), thoughpartlysimplified,well corresponds toaseriesofdescriptioninsChapter1
(IHathams cad 'dus pa 2es byaste phufipo dahpo 'i le'u,Jl<:-k"5)']JgXreNeg("Da yUn chtt fenda zh6ngjibn dU dlyi)) ofthe MMS (MMST 121a5-133a2, MMSc 1077c17-
1080c26).
As hasbeen already provedinthe previousstudies,iO) the MMS was a single source
from which Chapter 2 ofthe Suv long (71athagatdyumprama4anirdeq,u"otae:sparivarta
series ofpassages. Inother words, thecompilers of theSuvhadreferred totheMMS inen- largingChapter2of theSuv.Inthelighotf thesetwofactorst,hatis,thehighsimitarity of structure and content, and the circumstance under which Chapter2 ef the Suv was en- 1arged,itisreasonable to consider that the origin of the enlarged partinthe Mdanapari-
varta isalso theMMS. Thisconsideration also serves tostrengthen thevalidity of <the Hypothesis> which insisttshat inorder to emphasize the completeness of the Suv itscom-
haveconsistently collected thevarious kindsof doctrineaslready expounded inother pilers

4.Conclusion
Under circumstances where Buddhism was declining,the compilers of the Suv, by ob- taining various kindsof aid fromlaypeople,must haveattempted to survive inthe reli- giousworld fbrthesake of accomplishing thedutiesof theBuddhistclergy. Theyenlarged various timestheSuvinorder toemphasize itsvalue, usefulness, and completeness, with theirintentioenxpressed inChapter1which hasbeenlocatedat the beginningof the Suv
