O.Introduction
TheMSABh attributed toVasubandhu (imhElyanasatralarpkarabhds.va) (ca.400"80)
isone of the most importanttreatisesof the Yogacara tradition.Mordern scholars have es-
timated that the eighteenth chapter the Bodhipaksadhikara4a) of the MSABh was (i.e.,
composed under the strong infiuenceofthe seventeenth chapter the Bodhipaks.vapata- (i.e.
la)oftheBBh(Bodhisattvabhotfitmhie)MauliBhfimioftheYBh(Ybgdcarabhtimi) since these two texts largelyshare their teachings, and since, according to Odani [1984: 43-47] , the BBh issupposed to have been composed earlier than the MSABh. The excep-
tions are the thcories ofpuctgaianairatmya and ksarpabhangaf,brthey appear not inthe
BBh XVII butsolely inthe lastpartof MSABh XVIII. Hence, Iwamoto [1997][2000] has assumed that these theories were lateradded to MSABh XVIII. She even characterizes thetheoryofpuctgatanairatrnya intheMSABh as"Abhidharmatic." Concerningtherela- tionshipbetweentheAKBh and theYBh, inturn,Kritzer[2005]hasrevealed a resem- blancebetweentheteachingsofAKBh I-VIIIand theYBh, suggesting thc that
possibility the AKBh importedmany discussionfsromtheYBh. Basedon these precedingstudies, the

In case that pucigala can be said to be real by way of conception, the question arises:
Does thc pucigalaisidenticawilth or distincftrom fiveskancthas? The MSABh ad MSA XVIII 93 states that thepucZgataisneither identicanolr distinctfiromfiveskonduas. Itis becausc,ifthepudklalacan besaid tobeeither identicawilth or distinctfromfiveskanct- has,the pucigalamust be real and this would contradict the fundamentalpositionthat thc puLigala can bc said to be real only by way ofconception.

inAKBh IX,which runs as fbllows:
The pucigalavidinsassert that aputigala exists. [Tbdeterminatewhether or not theirassenion con- formstotheBuddha'steachings,]we must firsctonsider whether intheirview apersonissubstan- tiallyreal or isreal by way ofa conception.

Thus, the AKBh isarguing therelationship betweenpucigaland skandhas inthe similar manner astheMSABh.Addingtothis,AKBh IXcontinues todiscussthecasethatpucigata
isdistincftrom fiveskandhas:
Such a pucigalamust beeither conditioned or uncondi-
tioned, butboth are eliminated, since they are untenable and falseT.he possibilities
puciga- lavadinosr theVatsiputriyashcreintheAKBh also approve thatpuaigalacan besaid tobe
neither identicalwith nor distinctfrom fiveskandhas, but they also insisthatpucigala is neither substantially real nor real by way ofconception.
With regard to the relationship between pucigala and
skancthas, I would furtherliketo
cite the fbllowinrgefutation ofatmavdcia

(YBh l32, 13-133, 3)
Comparing the afbrecited passages from the MSABh, theAKBh and the YBh, one could say that the authors shares the ideathatpucigala or a-tman can be said to be neither identical with nor distincftromfiveskoncthas. Theyconsider thatifpu(igaloar a-tman can besaid to be either identicalor distincftrem fiveskancthas, itmust be real. Thisisthe traditional Buddhistdoctrineofnairatm),a. Consideringthehistoricoarlders ofthesethreetexts,one may assume thatthisdoctrinheandeddownfromtheYBh totheMSABh and theAKBh.
3.Fireand fuelanalogy
IntheMSABh ad MSA XVIII 95,the author criticizes the peoplewho employ the anal- ogy of fireand fuelto explain the relationship between pucigalaand skandhas. InAKBh IX,the author uses thesame argument torefute theVatsiputriywahe,reas itdoesnot occur intheYBh. Letus firsstee theMSABh:
If [,inthe absence of any reason,] itwere mere]y due to an example that they accepted that the puc(gatacannot be said [tobe either one and the same with or distincftrom thc skancthas, stating:]
fircean besaid tobeneither distincftromnor thesame as thefuei(ind]ianOan)e,s"hould re- p}y to them as fo11o"'s:Because of [theidristinct]characteristics, because ot' [thawthich is]

be either one [andthe same] or distinc[tfi:onme another] . For what we call "fire" is [nothing but]thee]ement fire(tojodhat[uw)h,ereatshe]fuel[consiosfltsthe remaining [threele]ments
