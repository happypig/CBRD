1.Introduction
The study of thc Sautrantikhaasreccntly made greatadvances, mainly becauseof the discoveroyfa relationship betweenthe Abhidharmakojabhd,vya (AKBh)and the ihgacara- bhitmi(YBh).Iin)thisregard, some scholaTs argue thatVl}subandhuwas already a Yogttcfira when hewrote theAKBh. Altheughitistruethatfrom thispointof view thestudy of the SautrEntikiasof greatimportanceI,cannot agree with thisopinion when one considers the fbllowingtwosituations. FirstV,asubandhudefinestheMahayanaasateachingthatpos- scsscs seven

With regard to dharma,on the other hand, he emphasizes the ineffableness of all dharmas.Theseare Mahayana doctrinetshathehimselfclearly articulates. Second, the interpretationf dharma on the basisof the tenets of the Mahayana, that is,thc inter- pretationthat all dharmas are ineffable,can be regarded as an innateYog5cara doctrine basedon thedescriptiobnySfigarameghaI.nhisfogacarabhtimi-,akhyaS,agaramegha describetshepositionofYogacara inthehistoroyfBuddhist thought as fbllowsA.ftcrthe

Turningbacktotherelationship betweentheAKBh and YBh, as faras Ican see, their corresponding passagesdo not centain these two doctrinetshat Vasubandhu himselfdefines as the teachings of the Mahayana. Neither isitrelated to the penetratingYogticEradoctrine of theineffableneosfsall dharmas,which isalso regarded as distinctiovfeVasubandhu's thought inthat itisfbundinboththe VYY and VS. Thus, what one can safely conclude is thatVlisubandhuwas aware oftheexistence oftheYBh when hewrote theAKBh and bor- rowed some ideasfrom iL
However,itisalso tme thata developmentof ideasisfoundinthetrajectoryof Vasu- bandhu'sthought and Sautrantiktaheorieswhose relationship with theYBh hasbeenre-

According to Kat6 1989,the Sautrantikatheories inthissense intheAKBh number sev-

The Sautrfintikcraisticize: ifthatisse, since mind and mental states themselves are also arisen from special absorption inthe immaterialworld, they are strong enough to support each other. Therefbret,here isno need of another basissuch as lifeforceor homogeneous character.
Asprevioustudies havepointedout, thisargument bytheSarvastiv5dcan, of course,
