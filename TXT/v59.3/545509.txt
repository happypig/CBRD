The treatisec,onsisting of tensections, then proceeds inthe fonnof questions being asked by a traveler, and answers being givenby a master of a household. The beautifu1 composition ofthe beginningofthis work ismore thanmere literareyxpression. Itisbased on calamities thatwere unprecedented, even ina Japan with a historoyfcontinuously oc- curring natural disasterTsh.e scale of those calamities can be graspedby reading IKEDA

Given the existence of such natural and social disorders,the questionarises, "Is Bud-

from the Buddhist viewpoint. The Kamakura Shogunateordered temples and shrines throughout the entire country to effer prayers as a countermeasure to these crises. But Nichirenraisestheissuethattheseprayersdidn'thaveany effectatall.Inhisopinion, the
