2.1.Bh5viveka hasstated thatinthe Yogacaras'view a universal inthe fbrmofany4poha iswhat istobcdenotedbyaword. Hegoeson tostatehisown view ofwhat istobede- noted byaword.

theuniversal (tasyaex)ists as such [aneffable] essential nature, itisnot reasonable that uni- [the
versal] isineffable."
According to BhEviveka, what isto be denoted by a word isan entity by a univeT- qualified
sal (saman.vavasatdu). Inhisview what isunderstood froma word issuch an entity. Itjs importanttonote that,asshallbeshown, what Bhavivekaconsiders heretobeauniversal isnot aayEZpoha butvijaMtlyena."tiayatva `emptiness ofa dissimilaenrtity' and thatheholds the view becauseheconsiders thatthe word go `cow,' fbrcxample, must refer toany cows and not to non-cows. Itwill be explained inMHK V 63 how the universal istreat-

view theuniversal isnot beyondverbalization and henceeffable.
2.2.MHK V 62 states that when he says that an entity qualifiedby a universal iswhat be denoted by a word, he means the emptiness of a dissimilaenrtity by the Luniversal'

each other, so that they can reside inone and the same entity. This will explain the second
pomt.
4.1.From thepointofview ofBhaviveka who holdsthatan cntity qualifiedbya universal
isdenotedby a word, ifairyopoha as conceived of by the Yog5cdrashad a claim to be a universal, then itwould have to be accepted that anyjipoha isdenotedby a word. But, in hisview, aayZipoha cannot betreatedas a univcrsal.
MHK V66ab: nttn.vap- oho 'ayasfimdn.vafn an.vadharmad' vis'esavat! ('-dharmtiLdi,]L2,I{,S,Ec; -dharmau SG, Ms) "[Thesis:] [Theuniversal called] an.v,tZpoha [ofanentity] isnot a universal
[commonto] another entity; [Reasonb:e]causeitisa propertydjfferjngfrom entity to cntity; [Ex- ample:] likea specific property(vis'esa)."
As cow x excludes non-x, so also does cow y exclude nono,. Cow x isqualifiedby an.vap- o- ha1 and cowy by anylipoha2. Inthis case, ifatryiipoha1were the same as an.viipoha2, then the two cows would be identicwaitlh each other. But ifanylipohal were diflfiefrreonmt aaya-
poha2, these two anyiipohas could not bc a universal. This iswhat Bhfivivekaintendsto say bystatingtheargument.
4.2.MHK V 66cd isto discussthe case inwhich aTo,tipoha that qualifieasn entity isnot differentiaftreodmaayjipoha that another entity.

InBhaviveka'sview, anyiipoha, as Kum5rilaargues, consists inabsence. That is,an.vEipo- ha amounts to anynbhava Cabsence ofothers,' or diffrtence. A dewlap isqualifiedby aaya-
pohal and a tailisqualifiedby an.vlipoha2. airyiipohal and an.vap'oha2 are the difference fromnon-dewlaps and thatfromnon-tails. According toTJ,absence hasno essential nature (ngobo q},idmedpa, *nih, svabhava) and hence issomething unreal.3) These two anyiipo-

In Bhaviveka's view, what isdenotebdy a word isan entity which isqualifiedby a univer- sal thatisnot distincftromtheentity. Thus itfo11owsthattheaayiipoha theYogficaras consider to be a universal which isdistincftrom itsqualificandcannot be denotedby a word. In addition, ifan entity which isnot by theairyopoha were denotedby a
qualified
word through the aaylipoha, then itwould fbllowthat the aayiipoha isnet denoted by the
word.
5.InMHK V 68 Bhaviveka concludes thatthe YogEcfiras'theory of `emptiness
of an efu-
bleintrinsniacture' isuntenable.

6.The fo11owingpointshave become clear: (1)Bhavivekaconsiders thatthe thcory ef

denyingthe propertyofbeing a universal to anytipoha, he can treataiu,iipoha as something likea specific propcrty.(5)He regards anyopoha as `absence of others' or `difference from others.'
Bhaviveka's arguments against the theory of apoha clearly show that in his view the world inwhich yerbalization takes placemust havethe conventional reality.
