Ifatl cenditioned dnarmas are mementary, thenkarmacan't bringabout itseffect, for karma isalse momentary. Th ¢ y give an example of seeds, and claim that seeds produce their sprouts at the very moment when they perish,which mcans that, having perished, they cannot produce them at a latertime. Karmas are also conditioned, and hence,they are momentary. Sincethcyperishwithout producingtheireffects, theycan never producetheir effects, as isthe case of sccd without itssprout. Moreover, once lcar-
pcrishing producing
mas are perished,theycannot be causes, fornonexistents cannot be causes.

Samghabhadra crkicizes theDErstantiktaheory ofa karmic continuum on two grounds. First,this theory isargued on thc ground that enly presentdliannas exist. Sarvastiv5da

tikatheory cannot be acccpted. In the firscthapter of NA, Saymghabhadra criticizes that the Darslantikanotion of kanmicseries isnot logicallyacceptable inthe case ofthe dcfinition
ofavijnNapti. Thatis,heobserves thatsince a continuurri consists ofmore than one parts,it cannot be real. Second,cven though the continuum isaccepted, the continuum of mind is
