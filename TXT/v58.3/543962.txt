story isnot traditionablutquitenew one. 6.Conclusion
My argument so farisonly support thercason thatSukthankarexcludcd theU-A story fromC.ed.However,itprovidesthetwo new perspcctiveson the study ofthe imageof Ur- vaSi. First,Ipointedout thattheimageof UrvaSiintheU-A steryisquitedifferentfrom theimagesofApsarases inany other works and hasuniqueness. Second,itispossibleto say thatthisimage iscreated incomparatively latetrimes.
Lastly,itisespecially worth mentioning thatintheU-A story Arjunasaid toUrvaSi thatLyou arc my anccstress, inother words, almost eclLiivalenttomy mother' when here- fuscdhertemptation.InbrieLAijuna hadalready beenregarded as thedescendantofPurU- ravas tacitlybythetimetheU-A story was compesed. Althoughtheterm`Kaurava' isused almost equivalent to `Paurava' in C.ed.,itis likelythat Paurava race that derivedfi;om PurUravaswas never thc same as Kauravarace longbefore]vfohwas arranged inthe prcs- ent form.Forexample, thekingPauravaappears as an opponent ofthe fivePErpdavaprinc- cs includinAgojuna.i7A)nd the fivePaodava princesare usua]ly cal1ed Kuru, Kaurava, and Bhgrata,butthcy are rarely called Paurava.Thatisto say, itissupposcd that somebody
who intendedtoraise thestatus of thegenealogyefPaqLdava princespositionedthefamous king Purturavas as theirancestor and made up the falseconnection between `Paurava and Kaurava'.
For the reasons mentioned above, itcan be concluded thathe U-A story isa quitenew
