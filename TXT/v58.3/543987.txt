(zztXtli!E)H.ishoiijiseverlasting and iscalled DainichiNyorai (JlUatUJII)7I)n.thiscase we can understand thatsignificant factoorf the name isthe placewhere a deityexists.
Itisnot clearifthesyncretistic case of Bankoand GozuTenno occurred inChinaor Japan,butitisclear thatthemixture of Buddhism and Chinesereligion started fromthe beginningof introductioonfBuddhism inChina.Actually,Holdnaiden'sfinaclhapter called Monju StikuyoK-lyo(tfiiMmeff)isabout divinationofEsoteric Buddhism (Sukuyodfoiime M) which was introducetdo Chinaand mixed with Chinese philosophy.For thisreason we
can assure thathe amalgamation processhad already started in China and continued also inJapan.
4.Conclusion
Frornthefo11owinegxamples we can assume thatthesyncretistic model thatappears in medieval Onmyodo, isvery complicated and can't beunderstood as a simple Buddhistic deity- Shintodeitycorrelation. Itismore preeiseto think of itas a cQmbinatory toolthat linksvarious deitieosr other entibies. Withoutdoubt,conventional ShinbutsuShagdcases appear inHbkinaiclenb,utthereare cases thatseem irregulaorquitecomplicated. Whileit isunderstood thatinHokinaiden a generaldistinctiobnetweenBuddhisticdcitieasnd Shintodeitie(sfberxample thedistinctionbetweenSanboKichinichiand KamiKichinichi)exists, sometimes itappears that this distinctiiosnignoredor very di'thcutlotdefinea,nd have cases of ShinbutsuShugo,where bothhoajiand suljaku are fromShintoor are bothfrom Buddhism, or even amalgamation to entities thatare obviously out of the sphere or Shinto or Buddhism. For thisreason we may speak more preciselyahout"Shinbutsuetc Shugo"
*M'theeeeA
than simply ShinbutsuShago,since theamalgamation are not limit-
patterns
ed only to Shintoor Buddhism. We are not ina positionto know ifthoseentities outside of
,
Shintoor Buddhism were understood as somcthing completely medieval Japanese thinkers, but without a doubt we can understand tounify allthosespheres intoone syncretistic system.
