TheAcquittal ofthe MentallyDisordered (anapatti)
1.Introduction
When the monk

of the safigha transgressedagainst the monastic law (vinaya-pitaka) ,
and wag therefore identifiedas the mentally disordered at the asscmbly <utnmattaka)i) of
monks (ummattakasammiuntmois)t,cascs hcwas certified transgressions. This acquittal of transgression forummattaka

of his guilty'(anapatti)
and khittacitta(onewhose ;nind isthrewn over) islikewiseapplicable tethemost serious punishmentsuch as pErajika
which would normally result inlifeloncgxpulsion fromthe safigha, ineach vinaya schools. The mcntally disorderemdonk who has been certified as such and thereforc acquittcd isdeprivedof hismonkhood by the saJlgha. However, he isnot purged from the sahgha.
Aftef'ward,ifhe himselfoffertse return to the sabgha and when he isadmittcd and certi- fiedthathe isnot mad (insanaeny)more at the assembly ofamrtlhavinaya, he isatonedi for
hispasttransgressions. Therefbrehecan regain hismonkhood.
Why the sahgha cstablishcd such a system forthe mentally disorderemdonk similar to
themodern system ofrehabilitation? Firstof all,we need toknow how theyunderstand the
mental disorderAsl.so,how they treatedthe mentally
cluded frem the community. Analyzingthis system
inthesafigha leadsus toelucidate theethicsofthevinaya pitakai.e.Budchistethics.The writer examincd the PEIiand the corrcsponding Chincse Tripitaka.
2.TheAcquittal (anapatotftihe) Mentally Disordered Monks
Thereare many kinds of acquittal of effences within the vinaya pitaka,most ofthcm are minor offences relating to dailylifesuch as duklcava: rcfiection or confessien to a monk. However, even inthe most serious offences i.e. the insane'ofthe
