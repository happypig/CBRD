The asallaksatianupraves'opdya-thcory has difl:icuilntayccounting fbrthe removal of at- tachment to things inthe empirica! world. Bhaviveka suggests that one should start with accepting theemphicat world as itis.Intheempirical world everything isbelievedtohave itsown essentialnature.

The pointisthatan object of a conceptual cogriition hastwo parts:thepartwhich iserro-

ceptual cognition `this isa rope' occurs, thisconceptual cognition isconsidered tocognize
thereal aspect of therope, while, when theconceptual eognition `this isa snake' occurs, this conceptual cognition isconsidercd to cognize the unreal aspect of the rope. In
Bhaviveka's view, accordingly, itisproperto say thata conceptual cognition isnot abso- lutelyan erroneous cognition and what isgraspedbya conceptual cognition isnot abso- tutelnyonexistent. Thercfbreitwould fo11owthatthe YogacEras,who abso]utely deny the reality ofan object ofa conceptual cognition, commit thefaulotfthe denialofrealities.
3.We have seen how BhEviveka refutes theYogEcEras' asallaksannnupraveSopaJ;a- and parikalpitasvabhava theories advocated by the Yogacaras.Two points are made by Bhaviveka: enc istbat the denialof the existence of theexternal world doesnot serve to
remove the attachment to the empirical world and theother isthat a valid conceptual cog-
nition can occur with reference to an external object. Itisimportanthat,fbrBhaviveka, even ifthe validity of a conceptual cognition isdemonstratedi,tisassessed only at the conventional levelE.ven iftheconceptual cognition `this isa rope' with reference to a rope which cxists cxtemally isvalid attheconventional level,thiscognition cegnizes therope as havingthe essential nature ofbeing a rope.
