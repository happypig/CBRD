[Mahay5na]
interprethe featuresappearing in thcSuv not as a tokcn of "thc assimilation of Buddhism into
Hinduism"or `tchc depravitoyfBuddhism," butas an attempt ofBuddhists tosurvive intheindian
religiuus vvrorld byemphasizing thevaluc, thcusefu1lless, and thecompleteness of [MahEy5na]・
Buddhism under thc circumstances where Hinduism had becQme more and mere dominantover

Furtherrnore,it may turn out that the Suv isnot L`a mere miscellaneous medley of doctrincsand rites," but a collcc- tion of them which isintrinsitce the value of thc Suv.
Suzuki [2009h]as provided the most recent stuciy on this subject, and the fo11owing tentativecenclusion hasbeenreached:
Buddhism had once stood fbremostinthe religiuus world ol- Indiaunder the patronage of tlie greatkings such as King ASoka ef thc Maury4 Empire and King ]<aniska of the Kiishan Empirc. However dLll/inagnd afier theGuptaperiodwhen theSuywas compiled, Buddhism hadalrcady lostitsdeminantpositiontoHinduism.Undersuch circumstances thecompilers oftheSuv,byob- t,aininvgarious kindsofald of thckingsas v,'ellas of theirpeople,must have attempted tosuwive inthereligiousworld forthesakc ofaccomplishing thedutiesot'theBuddhistclergy.

In thisrespect itmay seem fairto say that these two ehapters share theircontext.
However, most of the merits of the hearingofthe Suv we findactually inthe discourse ofthis Chapter22are mundane ones as fo11ows:

4.Conclusion
Inorder tosurvive intheIndianreligious world byobtaining various kindsof aid from
the kingsas well as theirpeople,thecompilers of the Suv edited such chapters as "the Five Chaptcrs"whose subjcct istoattain mundane merits. Inediting them they introduceadlot of featureswhich had been rathcr unusual forthe Buddhistseriptures befbrc.Butthe com- pilersof theS"v succeeded inintroducintghosefeaturewsithout havingdisturbetdhetra- ditionaildea or deviatedf'romthe orthodox fbnnula of Buddhism since the attainment of
t
supreme enlightenment by the Budcha Salcyamunis,jn accordancc with the Buddhist tra-
ditioni,nseparablyinkedtothewelfare ofallsentientbeingsintheSuv.Heremay lieone
of the reasons why theSuy has remained a Buddhist scripture thi'oughall the stages of its
iiormatioand transmission, however much the compilers of the Suv emphasized thc at- tainment o'fmundane merits, and however many featuresthey jntroducedintotheS"v
