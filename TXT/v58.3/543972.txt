1.T"Telve-factoredDependent OriginationintheMiuTtamadilyamakakartha (MMK) The only chaptcr in which the twelve factors(ofdependeornigtination) are directlmyen- tionedisChapter26.Inthischapter, thetraditionalinterpretatiofntwelve-factored dependent origination isexplained inplainterrnswith a focuson dependentorigination of arising aspect, and dependentorigination of cessation aspect istouched on only inthe last two ofthe twe]vcvcrscs making up thischapter. Ithasbeensuggcsted thatthischapter was
an early work ofN5gdrjuna thatwas appended totheMMK byother pcopleorbyNagaejuna himselftoserve as an explanation of dependenterigination intermsof conventional truth. Settingaside the question of whether or not thisview iscorrect, the followingverse is premisedon theexplanation ofdependent origination ofarising aspect inXXVI.2-5.

Whatever isdepcndcntoriginatien, thatwe declartoebeemptiness. Itis designatioInt. provisional

Thisshows thefourthmeaning ofdependentorigination, definedas"emptiness." (In XXIV.36 we findthephrase "emptiness thatisdepcmdcntorigination.") "Provisional designation" refers to the factthatindividnaelntities and existents are mere designationwisth no real substance, and itissynonytnous with what was expressed bytheeight negations and poinrts tothecontent of dependentorigination. Itshould go without saying thatdependentorigina- tionas the"middle "iay" corresponds tothcBuddha'steaching.
Thus the dedicatorvyerse represents nothing other than themain thesisof theMMK, namely, that dependent origination as taught by the Buddha isdependentorigination char-
acterized by thc eight negations (non-substanatndiaelmpititneyss), and this isdemonstrated bytheMMK asawhole. Toallintentasnd purposes,theproofendswith Chapter23,and
inChapter24itisdeclaredthatdependentorigination as taught bytheBuddha isnothing
other than emptiness as by thc author with the validity of this be- propounded (XXIV.18),
