The Role Played by Goddesses in the Haracaritacintamani
SHIBAZAKI Maho
1 Introduction
The Haracaritacintamani (HCC)by Jayadratha is a collection of religious stories written in Kashmir in the late 12th and early 13thcenturies AD.1)As its title (Hara- carita) and the repeated use of the phrase (Siva-carita)2i)n the preface (HCC1-1.5,11, 13,48) suggest, it is made up of myths and folklore regarding the deeds of Siva. A work steeped in Saivist belief, the HCC contains many explanations of the history and spiritual meaning of holy places, divinities, rituals, holy days and other ele- ments of religious life.
The HCC contains 32 stories, but the endings of two (HCC29 and HCC32) are missing. Of the 30 complete stories, 26 are either about Siva or feature him in an important role. Howeverin four almost consecutive stories in the second half of the HCC goddesses-Siva's wives-play a central role, while Siva himself is hardly mentioned. The four stories are as follows: HCC 22: The birth of Durga; HCC 23: Kausiki's defeat of the demons Sumbha, Nisumbha and Mahisa; HCC 25: The self- sacrifice of the Vidyadara prince Jimutavahana to save a serpent's life; HCC 26: The faithful servant Viravara.
This article describes the special characteristics of these goddess stories, consid- ers their place in the HCC as a whole, and offers a speculative answer to the ques- tion of why they are included. It focuses in particular on one story, HCC 26 Viravara. By comparing its plot to versions of the story predating the HCC I estab- lish some characteristics of the HCC. Based on this comparison and also on previ- ous research (Shibazaki,1997and 1998),I identify common characteristics of the four goddess stories and consider the background to their inclusion in the HCC. I also compare the content of the four goddess stories with the Siva-centric stories as a ba-

sis for considering how and why Jayadratha structured the HCC as he did.
2 The Viravara story: outline, versions and analysis
2.1 Outline of the story
HCC 26 tells the story of a faithful servant, Viravara, who sacrifices his son to a
goddess in order to prolong his king's life. The crisis is finally resolved by the god- dess. The elementsof the story are as follows:
A ABrahmancalledViravaracomestoaking(calledVikuramatungainsomever- sions and Sudraka in others)asks to enter his service, and is accepted.
B Viravara then demands a high salary from the king. The king agrees, but has his spies check on Viravara's conduct. Their reports convince the king of Viravara's
trustworthiness.
C Onenight,thekinghearssomeoneweeping,andordersViravaratofindoutthe
reason for the sorrow.The king secretly followsViravara.
D Findingawomanlamentinginthemiddleofalake,Viravaraasksthereasonfor
her sorrow. The woman, who is a goddess, tells him that the king's life will end three days from now. She also tells him that the only way to save the king is for Viravara to sacrifice his own son to the goddess Candika (Sarvamarngalain Hit. 3.8). Viravara goes home immediately.
E Viravara explains the situation to his family, and sets out with his family to the temple of Candika.
F Cutting off his son Sattvavara'shead, Viravara offers it to Candika.
G Seeing her brother's death, Viravara's daughter dies of a broken heart. With
Viravara'spermission, his wife kills herself in order to be with her children.
H Variant H1: His duty fulfilled, Viravara is about to sacrifice himself in order to
followhis family.
Variant H2: His duty fulfilled, Viravara cuts his own head off as a sacrifice to the
goddess.
I Observing all this, the king is about to cut his own head off in the hope that
Candika will revive Viravara and his family.
J A voice from the air stops him at the last moment, and all of Viravara's family
are brought back to life. Everyone returns to their homes. 1036

K The next morning, Viravara tells the king that there is nothing to report about the previous night's weeping. Astonished at his servant's dignity, the king tells the true story to his ministers and rewards Viravara.
2.2 Previous versions of the Viravara story
Severalversions of the story exist. One is found in Hitopadesa (Hit.)by Narayana,
where it features as an episode in the third chapter "Vigraha". The Kashmirian ver- sions of Brhatkatha, Ksemendra's Brhatkathamahjari (BKM) and Somadeva's Kathasaritsagara (KSS),which were based on the same source, both contain two versions.The first one is adopted as an episode in the main story.The second one is the fourth story of the Vetalapancavimsatika(Vet.)which was included in BKM and KSS as a sub-story. The Viravara story also appears in other versions of the Vet. (Kamimura1,978,pp.294-313b)uttheVet.versionsincludedintheBKMandKSSare the ones that havethe closestrelationshipwith the.compilationof the HCC, so I ex- cludethe otherVet.versionshere.
The followingversionsof the Viravara story, then, are known to have existedpri- or to the writing of the HCC: 1. Hit. 3.8 (Peterson, 1887,pp.112-116); 2. BKM 15.5.190-192(ShivadattaandParab,1982,p.525); 3.KSS9.3.86-193(Durgaprasad andParab,1915,pp.267-270); 4.BKMVet.4.(BKM9.6.263-332)(Shivadattaand Parab,1982,pp.308-314); 5.KSSVet.4(KSS12.11.5-123D)urgaprasadandParab,
1915,pp.414-417)
2.3 Comparingthe versionsof the Viravara story
Table 1 shows how the plot elementsare arranged in the HCC and the five previ-
ous versions.
Table 1: Plot structure of the Viravara story
Plot elements marked with an apostrophe differ slightly from the standard version.
The names of the city, the king, and Viravara's son differ between versions, as
1037
 (10) The Role Played by Goddesses in the Haracaritacintamani (M. SHIBAZAKI)
shown in Table 2.
Table 2: Characters and place names in the Viravara story
The six versions differ in the reason given for including the Viravara story in the overall narrative, as shown in Table 3.
Table 3: Reason for including the Viravara story in the overall narrative
Taking the three tables together, the versions fall into three pairs. The first pair, BKM 15.5 and KSS 9.3, stresses the role of the heroic servant, whose self-sacrifice (H1)is the climax of the story. This emphasis is reflected in the plot, in which the
king does not feature in the climactic scene, and made explicit in the overall narra- tive, which introduces the Viravara story as an example of a faithful servant. The twoversionsalsouse the same characterand placenames.Let us call this pair Type 1.
The second pair, BKM Vet.4 and KSS Vet.4, gives the leading role to the king, making his would-be sacrifice (I) the climactic scene. They use the same names, and also feature a question-and-answersession at the end of Viravara story which makes it clear that the king is the most courageous character. Let us call this pair Type 2.
The third pair, comprising HCC 26 and Hit. 3.8, does not fall neatly into either of the above groups. HCC 26 has a king-centric plot and gives the importance of the king as the reason for including this story in the overall narrative, but it employsthe same names as the versions that stress the role of the servant. Hit. 3.8, on the other hand, has a king-centric plot and uses the same names as the versions that stress the role of the king, but is included in its overall narrative as an example of the faithful

servant. There is no known connection between HCC 26 and Hit. 3.8, and the sig- nificant differences between them allow us to ignore Hit. 3.8 in this study.
These comparisons suggest that the author of HCC 26 wrote his version while re- ferring to at least two previous versions of the story, one Type 1 and one Type 2. Further evidence for this claim comes from the presence in HCC 26 both of verses that parallel KSS 9.3, a Type 1 text, and of verses that parallel KSS 12.11, a Type 2 text. Here are the relevant verses:

HCC 26 also contains several changes from all the previous versions, both Type 1 and Type 2. Two changes are particularly significant. First, the cause of the king's early death is explainedas his lack of devotionto Siva(HCC26.20-24.ab)t:his under- lines the importance of respect for Siva-a point made clear by the final verse of the story, HCC 26.65. Second, the king's devotionto the goddess Candika at the climax of the story is the key to the denouement:this underlines the importance of bhakti, which is mentioned in HCC 26.56, 59 and elsewhere.
Despite these differences and its use of different names, HCC 26 adopts the same king-centered perspective on the story as the Type 2 versions. The king's leading
1039
 (12) The Role Played by Goddesses in the Haracaritacintamani (M. SHIBAZAKI)
role is also expressed in the story's title "Vikramatunga" -the story does not have its owntitle in BKMVet.4andKSSVet.4-andin the tableofcontents(HCC1-1.41).3)
3 The Goddess stories in Jayadratha's narrative strategy
3.1The organizationof the HCC
HCC 25 relates Prince Jimutavahana's mercy and self-sacrifice, and just as in
HCC 26, devotion (bhakti) to a goddess brings a resolutionto the story and is there- by recommendedto the reader. These two stories also have in common the appear- ance in the climactic scene of Siva's wives Parvati and Candika to save the life of the hero. The two preceding goddess stories, HCC 22 and 23, feature well-known myths of Siva's wives Durga and Kausiki. Thus we have two pairs of stories sharing
similar themes.
These pairings lead us to suppose that Jayadratha selected and paired these four
stories because of these similarities. Is there evidence of a similar selection method in the HCC as a whole? The stories related to Siva in the HCC do allow a broad
classification:HCC1.2-9: Myths,traditionsandlorerelatedto Siva;HCC10-14: Storiesexplainingthehistoryofholyplaces;HCC15-21, 24:theteachingsormer- its of belief in Siva; HCC 27-29: Myths, traditions and lore related to Siva; HCC
30-31: ExplanationsofSaivadoctrine.
This grouping suggests a similar selective and organizing purpose on the part of
Jayadrathain the Sivastoriestoo. This is a promisingtopic forfuture research. 3.2 Sources of the Goddess Stories
What literature did Jayadratha refer to when he composed the goddess stories? An analysisof HCC22and 23 remainsto be done, but Shibazaki(1997)established closelinksbetweenHCC25andtheKSSversions,and Shibazaki(1998)demon- strated that HCC 27, which is the background story of Gunadhya, the author of the Brhatkatha, was written in reference to the KSS. This article has found similar par- allels between HCC 26 and KSS texts as the above two papers. We can therefore ar-
gue that three sequential stories, two of the goddess stories (HCC25 and HCC26) and the Siva story HCC 27,were written based on the same source,the KSS.
In addition to the KSS, we know that Jayadratha referred to at least one sastra, as he mentions it in the preface. In HCC 1.1.5the words "sastra-drstani caritrani", and
1040
 The Role Played by Goddesses in the Haracaritacintamani (M. SHIBAZAKI) (13)
then in HCC 1.1.48 the words "caritany... tani sastratah" may indicate one particular source which is not extant. But it is more likely that they indicate several "sastras" .
Jayadratha, however, does not name any particular sastras in the preface.
Jayadratha was born into a highly respected and educated family; his father was a minister of king Rajaraja and his brother was the well-known poet Jayaratha. We have several references attesting to Jayadratha's scholarly life and devotion to
Saivism. Thus he would have had access to, and understanding of, a large number of texts. Gupta argued on the basis of text comparisons that Jayadratha refered to the Matsya, Padma and Sivamaha Puranas while writing the HCC.4) Jayadratha
probably went through a number of puranas extracting stories that fitted the HCC's themes.
4 Conclusion
Jayadratha seems to have compiled the HCC by collecting stories that fitted his three main themes of Siva legends, holy places, and Saivist devotion and arranging them in thematic groups. The goddess stories discussed in this article form another theme, included towards the end of the collection. One of them, the Viravara story, combines elements of at least two different previous versions of the story and also adds its own Saivist emphasis.
In the preface Jayadratha explains that his narrative is much more accessible than his previousworks(HCC1-1.7-1-1.8)a,5n)dpeopleof high(uttamanamm),edium (madhyamanama)n,d low capacity(adhamanam)will all benefitin their different waysfromthis narrative(HCC1-1.11-13)H.6e)maythus haveincludedthe goddess storiesin orderto maketheHCCappealto a wideraudience.
