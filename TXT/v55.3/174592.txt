Discerning the Original Language of the Tibetan Versions of Mahayana Sutras
From a Simple Mistake in the lDem kar ma Regarding the Ajatasatrukaukrtyavinodhanasutra
MIYAZAKI Tensho
1 Introduction
An excellent historiographer may sometimes make a mistake. Once the error is compiled in an influential catalogue, it can long be accepted as historical fact, in- deed until it is noticed and corrected. The account of the Ajatasatrukaukrtyavinodh- anasutra (AjKV)given under the caption of "Mahayana sutras translated from Chinese" in the lDem kar ma (Dk),1) one of the oldest and the most authoritative Tibetan catalogues of Buddhist canonical scriptures, is most likely to be one such case.
What strikes us first about the understanding of the origin of the Tibetan ver- sion of the AjKV is the discrepancy found between the Dk and the 'Pang than ma (Pt).2) The two are almost contemporary(around the first half of the 9th century), but unlike the Dk, the Pt classifies the sutra among "sutras translated from
Indian."3) Since there seems no doubt that both catalogues refer to the same extant
AjKVc,omposedoffivefascicles,thetruthwilllieeitherintheaccountoftheDkor in that of the Pt. To examine which account is more credible, this paper will dis-
cuss the subject from the following three viewpoints: first, what the colophon sug-
gests, second, what Chinese materials suggest, and third, the use of relatives in Tibetan translations.
2 What the Colophon Suggests
The colophon of the AjKVmentions two scholars as those engaged in the translation
of the sutra: Manjusrigarbha,an Indian monk, and Ratnaraksita,a Tibetan monk re- ferred to in the Sgra sbyor bsam po gnyis pa.4) Neither scholar leaves any sign of having translated material from Chinese scriptures. Given that specialists well versed in Chinese Buddhist scriptures were obviouslyneeded in the projects involv- ing translationof sutrasfrom Chinese,the extantTibetanversionis thereforeclearly 1101

not taken from a Chinese original.
3 What Chinese Materials Suggest
Since each of the extant three Chinese versions of the AjKV,i.e. the Asheshi wang
jing阿 闇 世 王 經(T626), the Wenshuzhili puchao sanmei jing文 殊 師 利 普 超 三 昧 經 (T627), and the Weicengyou zhengfa jing未 曾 有 正 法 經(T628), shows no literal agree- ment with the extant Tibetan version, we are left with the possibility that either the Dk is erroneous or, if the record is in fact correct, that the text mentioned in the Dk could represent a missing Chinese version of the sutra. The Kaiyuan shijiao lu開 元 釋 教 録(T2154,730 CE), in fact, argues that"the AjKV has three extant versions and three missing versions."5) With whatever little certainty we attach to this source, it cannot be completely denied that the sutra referred to by the Dk may have been among these three missing versions. In addition, there is another possibility that a specific text translated into local, vernacular Chinese, thereby escaping the attention of the compiler of the Chinese catalogue,6) might have been made use of by Tibetan scholars and listed in the Dk.
However, how should we examine such a possibility that "an extant text" could have been translated from "a missing text?" The examination of the description in the Dk conducted thus far has involved no more than circumstantial observations, and we will remain in a fog unless we change viewpoints. We will now move on to the third, and final, perspective that points to "the style of translation" as direct evi- dence of the original form of the sutra.
4 The Use of Relatives in Tibetan Translations
One of the most effective indices with regard to "style" to distinguish Sanskrit from Chinese is the use of relatives; Sanskrit has highly developed relative structures that are completely lacking in Chinese. Tibetan translators, while originally unfamiliar with the use of relatives but later introducing them through the process of transla- tion from Sanskrit, felt the right to adopt a different style of translation in terms of a relative structure in accordance with the stylistic differences of the original texts. The use of relatives can effectively function as the method for discerning the origi- nal of Tibetan translations.7) However, given the complete lack of philological stud- ies on this theme, a couple of examples will be shown by quoting from the Mahayana sutras before proceeding to examine the case of the AjKV

(1) the Purnapariprccha and the Suvarnaprabhasa
Two Mahayana sutras are regarded as having been translated from Chinese: the
*Purnapariprccha (D61, PurP)8) and one of the Suvarnaprabhasas (D555,Suvch>tib).9) In these sutras, while a certain kind of relatives proved to have originated from
Chinese does appear, another attested to in Sanskrit never does.

Yi"名 為,"ji shi"即 是,etc., as shown below, is an example fbr the case in which a
style that had originally been devised for the purpose of translating from Indian originals was applied at a later time to translation from Chinese tinged with the nu- ance of "paraphrase" or "emphasis."

de'i tshe" or "nam zhig-de'i tshe," common phrases corresponding to "yada- tada" in translations from Sanskrit originals. Probably for the reason that this struc- ture, when translated, is difficult to retain in Chinese, the lack of its appearance can be used as an index that suggests the original should be Chinese. An ideal example for this case can be drawn from the Suv, which has two Tibetan translations, one from Chinese and another from Sanskrit, as shown below.

(2) AjKV
In the extant Tibetan translation of the AjKV,there are many kinds of relative struc-
tures, one of which is "the relative clause of time" as mentioned in (d). It will suf- fice to quote here an example from Sanskrit fragments fortunately preserved in the Schoyen Collections.16)

5 Conclusions
The conclusions reached above were that, first, the colophon suggests that the trans-
lators of the extant AjKV had no involvement in the projects translating from Chinese texts, second, the existing Chinese AjKV shows no literal agreement with the Tibetan versions, and third, the distinctive condition of Chinese originals lack- ing the clause of time is not satisfied by the extant AjKV Thus, the classification employed by the Pt that must be correct and it is highly likely that the compiler of
the Dk made a simple mistake in recording the name of the sutra. 1104
