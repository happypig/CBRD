On raksases in Vedic ritual 1) TS 6.1.8.4; 6.2.10.2; 6.3.9.2
IZAWA Atsuko
1. In Vedic ritual, raksases attack the sacrifices, and are finally expelled by the sacrificers or priests.2)Though we often come across such a scene, especially in the Black YajurVeda Samhitas, it is not clear what the raksases really are. Therefore, I have extracted the words identified with raksases in order to determine their sub- stance. These words are categorisedinto the following four groups:

 (2) On raksases in Vedic ritual (A. IZAWA)
The raksases as praheti do not belong to enemies, but are regarded as the weap- ons against the enemies.
Among these [1]and [2] should be noted. [1](a)(b)and (c) are negative emotions,
and (e) and (f) are found in Satapatha Brahmana (SB). So far it seems the raksases
are connected with emotions such as gratis (hostility-not favourable)and gmatis
(thoughtlessnessi)n the Black Yajur Veda Samhitas. However, the connection be-
tween these words and the raksases is not strong enough, because these words are
mentioned only in the mantras and regarded as raksases in the Brahmana portions.
And it is not clear whether the negative emotions are directed toward the sacrifices,
devas or sacrificers (priests).Regarding this point, [2](c)is more concrete in that yo 'sman dvesti yam ca vayam dvisma' is connected with the raksases . Therefore, in

Second, these three will be compared with the corresponding sentences in the other
Yajur Veda texts. Last, I will examine the other sentences that contain the mantra `yo 'smandvestiyam ca vayamdvisma.'

' This raksas here I lead to the lowest darkness, who hateth us and whomwe hate,' he says;
there are two (kindsof) persons, he whom he [2] hates and he who hates him; both these he leadsto the lowestdarkness.
In these Brahmana portions, it seems the original two mantras are made one, and the raksas is identified with 'yo 'sman dvesti yam ca vayam dvisma,' which is inter-
preted as two persons. In order to detemine whether or not such interpretation is common, I will next examine the following corresponding sentences in the other
Yajur Veda texts:
(1)KathakaSamhita(KS)24.4(93.4-18)=KapisthaKlatha Samhita(KapS)37.5 (198.8-21)9)
(2)KS25.9(115.14-18)=KapS40.3(224.11-13()2;)MaitrayanSiamhita(Ms) 3.8.8
(105.17-106.4); 3(.26).S1B.4-5 (3)SB3.8.2.14-1510)
3. The relationship between the corresponding sentences and the original man- tras is as follows:
(1m)KS2.5 (11.4-6)(,2m)2.12(17.2-3) idam aham raksaso griva apikrntamidamaham yo nas samanoyo 'samano'ratiyatitasyagrivaapikrntami

the raksases. 'Thus I cut the neck of him who, equal to me or not equal, has hostile inten- tions,' he says. For he, equal or not equal, has hostile intentions: it is by this that he reached all.

' Herewith I cut off the neck of the raksases!' for the spade is the thunderbolt: it is with the thunderbolt that he cuts off the neck of the raksases
(3m)VS6.16. idamahamrakso'bhitisthamidamahamrakso'vabadhaidamahamrakso 'dhamam tamo nayami

' Herewith I tread down the raksas! herewith I drive away the raksas! herewith I consign the raksas to the nethermost darkness!' Thus it is by means of the sacrifice that he drives away
the destructions12),the raksases.
In the corresponding sentences there is no yo 'sman dvesti yam ca vayam dvisma.' Note that KS and KapS identify the raksas with the enemy. As for the mantra of KS and MS, 'idam aham raksaso griva apikrntami' is followedby 'idam aham yo nas (me) samano yo 'samano 'ratiyati tasya griva apikrntami,' and MS 3.8.8explainsthese two individually.
From this it is found that only TS connects the mantra 'yo 'sman dvesti yam ca vayam dvisma' with the raksas.
4. In the other sentences that contain the mantra 'yo 'sman dvesti yam ca vayam dvismas....or 'yam dvismoyas ca no dvesti...'there are few cases in which the one whohatesusandwhomwehateisidentifiedwiththeenemy(TS3.5.3.1M;S4.1.10 (13.4)o)rthecompetitor(MS1.5.11(79.19-80.4)).
Araru (the nameof the asuraraksas-see SB 1.2.4.17a)ppears in TS 1.1.9.1-2,MS 1.1.10(6.3-8)andSB1.2.4.16-17H.owever,thereisnoidentification,butjustthefact that the location of the mention of Araru in TS is nearer to the mantra than in MS
and SB.

 On raksases in Vedic ritual (A. IZAWA) (5)
Although TS 6.3.2.2 does not contain the mantra, the way of identifying the dve- samsi with the raksamsi appears similar to that of TS 6.1.8.3-4; 6.2.10.1-2; 6.3.9.2-3. The relationship between TS 6.3.2.2 and the original mantra is as follows:
TS 1.3.4.1a13)R=gVeda(RV)8.79.3 tvamsomatanukfdbhyo14d)vesobhyo'nyakrtebhyauruyantasi varuthamsvaha.../
Thou, O Soma, art the giver of wide protection from hostility, brought about by ourselvesor by others.hail!
‖‖‖
TS 6.3.2.2
tvam soma tanukrdbhya ity aha tanukrd dhy esa dvesobhyo 'nyakrtebhya ity ahanyakrtani hi
raksamsi
'Thou
, O Soma, brought about by ourselves,' he says, for he is the one who brings about by himself; 'from hostility, brought about by others,' he says, for the raksases are brought about by others.
The corresponding sentences are KS 26.2, KapS 40.5, MS 3.9.1 and SB 3.6.3.2- 21, among which only MS and SB mention the above mantra. In MS 3.9.1 (112.8-9) 'tanukrdbhyodvesobhyo'nyakrtebhya'is interpreted as 'yad eva tanukrtam canyakr- tam cainas tad etenavayajati' (it is the evil whichis madeby ourselvesor by othersthat he wards off); in TS 6.3.2.2 'tanukfdbhyo dvesobhyo 'nyakrtebhya' is divided into two and 'taniikrdbhyo' is connected with the soma and `dvestobhyo'nyakrtebhya' is identifiedwith the raksases.
5. Conclusion
In TS 6.1.8.3-4; 6.2.10.1-2;6.3.9.2-3, the original two mantras are regarded as if
one mantra, and the raksas is identified with 'yo 'sman dvesti yam ca vayam dvisma.' Such interpretation is not found in the other texts.
MoreoverTS 6.3.2.2 divides the original one mantra into two, and identifies ha- tred with the raksases.
Hence one can say that in the Black Yajur Veda Samhitas, where the raksases are
just vaguely connected with the negative emotions, TS is in a unique position in the respect that it tries to identify the raksases with hatred or persons who hate the sac-
rificer or whom he hates.

In SB, nastra and raksamsi are always found as a set, but in the case of KS 7.10(12.9- 11)and 37.8 (16-19),nastra is mentioned only along with the raksas.
In the SB, about one third of the passages containing asura- or a compound or de-
rivative of this word in fact have the compound asuraraksasa-. Cf. Hale, W.E. [1986] Asura- in Early VedicReligion, Delhi, p.177.
A circle is drawn round the seventh footprint of the Soma cow and mantra d is re-
peated, followedby e.
A line is drawn round with mantras b and c, before the erection of the sadas.

English translations of TS given in this paper are those in Keith, A.B. [1967] The Vedaof the Black YajusSchool entitled TaittiriyaSanhita, part land 2 (Harvard Oriental Series 18 and 19),Delhi. Keith, however, translated this sentence to `Thus I cut the neck
of the raksas'; 'Who hateth us and whom we hate.' Cf. part 2, p.496.
