The Ideal of the Bodhisattva King in Sri Lanka and the Reform of the Sangha
YABUUCHI Satoko
1.<Introduction> The legitimacy of the kingship in Sri Lanka, where Buddhism wasintroducedby theconversionofaking,wasacknowledgedbytheroleof the king as a promoter and a protector of Buddhism. As the qualities of an ideal Buddhist king were gradually spread through the society, the concept of a king as a bodhisattva came to be applied to political ideology, and the king's authority was so much strengthened that kings in the island not only purified the Buddhist sangha but also carried out ecclesiasticalresponsibilities.This article, based on historical materials in the Pali chronicles and epigraphic sources, gives a historical overview of this process from the Anuradhapurato the Polonnaruvaperiod.
2. <The Anuradhapura Period> According to the Pali chronicles, Buddhism was officially introduced into Sri Lanka in the 3rd century BCE by a son of the Indian Emperor Asoka, Mahinda, who converted King Devanampiyatissa(250-210 B.C.)to Buddhism. Buddhism thereafter became the national faith of the island. The Buddhist community had its headquarters at Mahavihara, and it developed and spread all through the island under the control of the single school of Mahavihara. However, the first secession, that of the Abhayagiri vihara, from the Mahavihara school occurred in the reign of Vattagamani Abhaya (89-77B.C.)1)Then a faction which left the Abhayagiri school in the reign of Gothabhaya (253-266A.D.) also formed an independentschool at Jetavana, which was built by King Mahasena (276- 303A.D.)2)Thesethree schools,i.e.,Mahavihara,Abhayagiri,and Jetavana,existed independentlyofoneanotheruntilKingParakkamabahuI(1153-118A6.D.)united them into one in the Polonnaruvaperiod.
Buddhist kings were called bodhisattva only after a new sect of Buddhism known as Vetulyavadaappeared in Sri Lanka during the reign of Voharikatissa(214- 236 A.D.)3) The title of mahasatta, compassionateto all beings, was given to King

Sirisarnghabodh(i251-253A.D.)4)He was consideredto be a paragon of virtue and a zealous patron of the faith who led a life of piety and practiced the ten royal virtues. He, in fact, became the ideal model of a king in Sri Lanka that endured for genera- tions after him. According to the Pali chronicles, kings thereafter were sometimes referred to by his name, i.e., Sirisarbhabodhi, in the chronicles and epigraphs, thus crediting them with the same virtues. Buddhadasa(340-368A.D.)is said to have led the life of a bodhisatta.5)Upatissa I (368-410A.D.)was credited with having prac- ticed the ten paramitas.6)Aggabodhi I (575-608A.D.)aspired to the attainment of the
highestenlightenment7,)andSenaI(833-853A.D.)toBuddhahood.8)
In the early Anuradhapura period, some kings who extended special favors to
the Abhayagiri school were involved in some kind of the bodhisattva cult. However, in the middle of the Anuradhapura period, the bodhisattva cult was well recognized as an ideological factor of kingship, implying that a king should have a moral re- sponsibilityfor the country and inducing him to lead the exemplarylife of a bodhi- sattva, regardlessof which monasticschoolshe favored.
After the late Anuradhapura period, the legitimacy of the kingship came to be foundedon the claim of a king being a blood relative of the Buddha. No evidence of a king actually claiming to be a descendant of the Sdkya clan is found before the tenth century, when the claim occurred for the first time in an inscription in the reignofKassapaV(914-923A.D.),9w)howasoneofthemostprominentscholarsof his time. This claim also occurs in a stereotyped manner in the epigraphic records ofhissuccessors,DappulaIV(924-935A.D.),10M)ahindaIV(956-972A.D.),11a)nd MahindaV(982-1029A.D.)12T)histrend canbetracedbacktotheeighthcentury, when originally ecclesiasticalterms like vat-himi,which were.used in reference only to the sarigha in earlier times, came to be applied to kings as well. In addition, an attempt to elevate the position of the king to a stature equal to the highest ranks of theBuddhistorder,namely,thatoftheBuddha,bodhisattva,orarhat, isevidentin the use of the term pirinivan in reference to the demise of kings, namely,a term as- sociatedwith the Buddhaand arhats.
The description of a king as a bodhisattva and the claim that he was actually kin to the Buddha indicate that the king, by the tenth century, came to be virtually recognized as the head of the Buddhist church, on both symbolical and political lev-

els. They enhanced the authority of a king over the sarigha so he could, and did, in- tervene to settle disputes, set up regulations for the administration of monasteries, and initiatepurificationsthroughdisciplinarymeasures.Suchinterventionswereef- fected by several kings, some of which in the late Anuradhapura period were in- scribed in epigraphic records as Vihara Katikavata, collectionsof rules for the re- cluses in the temples. The Vihara Katikavata served as a role model for the Sasana Katikavata, promulgated after the Polonnaruva period, which was rigidly enforced on every reclusein Sri Lanka.
3. <The Polonnaruva Period> After the Polonnaruvaperiod, some kings were sometimesdescribed as being a Cakkavattin,although this term never used about a
king during the whole period of the Anuradhapura kingdom. Jayabahu I (1110-1111 A.D.),GajabahuII (1132-115A3.D.),Parakkamabahu10 153-118A6.D.),Nissankamalla (1187-119A6.D.),and Lokissara (1210-121A1.D.)are entitled Cakkavattin in some chronicles and inscriptions. The northern parts of Sri Lanka fell into the power of the South Indian kingdom Colas in 1017and remained a subject state until 1070, when VijayabahuI (1055-111A0.D.)defeatedthe Colas and becamethe king of Sri Lanka. He resided at Polonnaruva,which he made the capital of his kingdom. The fact that the title Cakkavattin referring to him and to other warrior kings is used in the chronicles in the context of describing their frequent conflicts with rival claim- ants suggests that the title does not necessarily mean "a rule by non-violence,"as the Palicanonwouldsuggest.Inaddition,giventhatthe expressionCakravartti(kal) as a royal title appears in the Tamil inscriptions of South India earlier than in the Sinhalese in Sri Lanka in the Polonnaruva period, and that the title of Cakravartti(kal) had come into vogue in the Cola kingdom earlier than in Sri Lanka, the use of the term Cakkavattin for kings in the Polonnaruva period in Sri Lanka was probablya borrowing from the Cola practice.
Another departure from tradition in terms of Sinhalese royalty in this period was apparent in respect to personal names. Kings in the Anuradhapura period most- ly had the names closely associated with the Buddhist tradition, such as Buddhadasa, Upatissa, Agghabodhi, Sarnghatissa, Moggallana, Mahinda, and
Kassapa, whereas in the Polonnaruvaperiod, none of the kings had a name of spe- cial Buddhist significance. Vijayabahu, Jayabahu, Vikkamabahu, Virabahu,

(111)
Gajabahu, Parakkamabahu, and Nissankamalla are all names which are associated with heroic qualities.
However, the concept of the bodhisattva king still remained a living tradition at this time, as is shownin the names of some kings in the Polonnaruvaperiod who are described as Sirisanghabhodhi,meaning an ideal king, such as VijayabahuI,13) ParakkamabahuI,14N)issarnkamalla,1S5a)hasamalla(1200-120A2.D.),1a6n)dLokissara.17) VijayabhahuII (1186-118A7.D.)was literallycalled bodhisatta.18)
Parakkamabahu I was termed Cakkavattin19a)s well as Sirisanghabodhiand re-
garded as being endowed with both heroic and bodhisattva characteristics. He
gained absolute control of all regions and all social groups in the island, which had been in complete chaos after the demise of Vijayabahu I. Conscious of his supreme
authority over the island, ParakkamabahuI decided to reunite the sarigha under the leadership of the Mahavihara school, a feat that no other king before him had ever been able to achieve. In addition, he issued the first Sasana Katikavata for all re- cluses. The greatest political contribution of this unification of the sarigha was to institute the title of Mahasami for the supreme hierarch of the sarigha, through whom the king could control clerical affairs and exert his authority over the
Buddhist order.
4. <Conclusion> As has been described, the bodhisattva cult as an ideology for kingship developedfrom the early Anuradhapura period. Regarding a king as a bo- dhisattva led to the identification of the king with the highest ranks of the Buddhist order and increased the legitimacy of his authority to rule over and unite it, as ParakkamabahuI did, in the Polonnaruvaperiod.
