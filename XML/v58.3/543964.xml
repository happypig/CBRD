The japanese ssociationof indian and buddhist studies )journalofindicnd buddhist studies vol.58,no.3, march0 The acquittal (anapatti) of the Mentally disordered Monks KoikE kiyoyuki 1.Introduction when the monk of the sangha transgressed against the monastic law (vinaya-pitaka), and was therefore identified as the mentally disordered (ummattaka)at the assembly of monks(ummattakasammuti), in most cases he was certifled 〓not guilty' (anapatti) of his transgressions. this acquittal of transgression for ummmattaka and khittacitta (one whose mind is thrown over) is likewise applicable to the most serious punishment such as paraiika which would normally result in lifelong expulsion from the sangha, in each vinaya schools. The mentally disordered monk who has been certified as such and therefore acquitted is deprived of his monkhood by the sangha. however, he is not purged from the sangha. afterward, if he himself offers to return to the sangha and when he is admitted and certi-fied that he is not mad (insane) anymore at the assembly of amulhavinaya, he is atoned for his past transgressions. Therefore he can regain his monkhood. why the sangha established such a system for the mentally disordered monk similar tc the modern system of rehabilitatio? first of a11, we need to know how they understand the mental disorders. also, how they treated the mentally disordered who were prone to be ex-cluded from the community. analyzing this system of how to treat the mentally disordered in the sangha leads us to elucidate the ethics of the vinaya pitaka i. e. buddhist ethics. the writer examined the pali and the corresponding chinese tripitaka. 2.the acquittal (anapatti) of the mentally disordered monks There are many kinds of acquittal of offences within the vinaya pitaka, most of them are minor offences relating to daily life such as dukkata : reflection of confession to a monk. however, even in the most serious offences i.e. parajika, the "legally insane' of the mentally disordered, the first offender, or one who is in ignorance of meaning of the fact  The japanese associationof Indian and buddhiststudies The acquittal (anapatti) of the Mentally disordered monks (k. koikE) and one who has no intention are judged not guilty. followings are the precepts that one should notkill living-things in each vinaya schools. anapatti asancicca ajanantassa na maranadhippayassa ummattakassa adikammikassa' ti (Thera-vada)2). Acquittal is given to a first offender, or to one who is insane or suffers intolerable pain from diseases (dharmaguptaka3), mula-sarvastivadin4)). Acquittal is given to someone who is insane (mahasanghika)) How did early budchism evolve the concept ofummattaka? early buddhist textse) de-scribed a brahman lady vasitthi who lost her sons, as the typified case of ummattaka. "afhicted by grief for my son, with my mind deranged, out of my senses, naked, and with dishev-eled hair. i wandered here and there. i dwelt on rubbish heaps in the streets, in a cemetery, and or highways. i wandered for three years, consigned to hunger and thirst. (Theri.133-134)", 〓 Next case is a householder who grieved for his beloved only son. "now on that occasion, a certain householder's dear and beloved only son had died. after his son's death, he had no more desire to work or to eat. he kept going to the charnel ground and crying "My only son, where are you? my only son, where are you" other typifed cases of the insane who transgressed against the precepts of the vinayas are as follows: "now at that time the monk gagga was mad, out of his mind, and while he was mad, out of his mind he perpetrated much and spoke in a way that was not worthy of arecluse."9)vin. ii,80). cThe monk nanda was mad, out of his mind, he perpetrated much and spoke in a way that was not worthy of a monk. sometimes he attended at the convention kamma, uposatha) , and often he was bsent from them. (Dharmaguptaka)"1c 〓る vasitthi was discussed iabhidhamma texts1, especially about the five causalities of mental disorders. i suggest that the state of vasitthi was one of chronic psychosis (severe mental disorders). however, the texts describe the brahman lady as suffering from a reactive psychosis caused by bereavementthe householder appears to have become depressive or melancholy after he was bereaved from his only son. according to the texts, these two cases are representative of people's sufferings (dukkha), that is piyehi vippayogo dukkho' (the suffering of being separated from those whom one loves), one of the eight maior sufferings. These descriptions show us how buddhismcoped with the dukkha especially who have ex-perienced the suffering of people caused by bereavement.  The japanese associationof Indian and buddhist studies the acquittal (anapatti) of the mentally disordered monks (k. koIke) The vinaya pitaka illustrated ummattaka, khittacitta, and vedanatta as the cases worthy of an acquittal of ummattaka. regarding ummattaka, the text interpreted five causalities those which are : loss of parents, loss of property, disharmony of the four great elements (maha-bhutani ), being persecuted with amanussa (non-human beings, yakkha, local natural di-vinities) and kamma (the preexistent action)this is roughly similar to pathogenesis in modern terminology, that is, grief4caused by bereavement (psychogenesis), economics, somatic disease (somatogenesis), possession or hallucination ofnon-human beings (psycho-sis) and a stubborn disease (or an incurable disease, the so-called kamma-disease). Regarding khittacitta, the text explained five causalities such as: dread of amanussa. being beaten by amanussa, being bled of energy by amanussa, disharmony ofthe four great elements and kamma. The text also emphasized causality of amanussa in khittacitta. re. garding vedanatta, afficted by pain, was said to be caused by somatic disease such as wind disease, fever disease, cold disease, complications of these three kinds of diseases, and sea-sonal diseasevedanatta is seems to be intolerable pain caused by a serious illness ummattaka or khittacitta is not always an acquittal. ifa monk is conscious of commit-ling parajika, he commits parajika. also if ea mad monk intentionally tries to murder omeone, and this man dies, the monk violates parajika. butif the person does not die, the monk violates thullaccaya."10/ buddhism always emphasizes manaskammaor intention, as it is written as, "to purify one's mind, that is the teaching of (a11 ) the awakened. (dhp. 83)1).under the modern japanese criminal law, the mentally disordered are not always incompetent. however, if someone is judged as incompetent in court, he mmay receive an acquittal based on that fact. likewise, the modetn criminal law does not impose the first offenderif the law is not yet legislated at the time of committing the crime19). 3.ummattakasammuti, amulhavinaya and Rehabillitation Monks adomonished each other not to transgress the rules of the vinaya. if a monk spoke irrelevantly or behaved unworthy of a monk: therefore, transgressed the tules anc duties of the sangha, this monk was reproved by other monks. after he was certified as in-sane at the ummattakasammuti, he was not guilty (acquittal). however, instead of an ac-quittal, his monkhood was deprived and then he was puton'good behaviour'. when he recovered from his illness and he applies himself to the sangha for rehabilita-tion, monks of the sangha assemble the amulhavinaya. at the assembly i.e. the amulhavi-  the japanese ssociation of Indian and buddhiststudies The acquittal (anapatti ) of the mentally disordered monks(k. koike)(41 naya, the monk would confess that he did not remember that he had committed an offence and that now he had recovered his insanity. Some monks would then reprove him for his past offence. however, to te-admit the monk, as he was no longer insane at the amulhavi-naya was not necessarily decided only by amajority of the sangha. by virtue of remarks of some modest monks, he could finally be judged as amulha (not insane) and so he was atoned for his past transgressions. Remarks fro sensible, modest monks of few wants were stressed at the amulhavinaya. Thus his monkhood was accepted by the sangha. concerning an acquittal of the insane, there is a rough similarity between the vinaye and the modern criminal law in which the incompetent mentally disordered are found not guilty, as above mentioned. However, the difference is atonement of the past transgres-sions in the vinaya. these disciplinary features of the vinaya are necessary for the monks who are striving to attain enlightenment. incidentally, ancient hindu law, such as the mc presumed the mentally disordered criminal to have diminished responsibility. it is noted that punishment was not so cruel, as was followed by atonementin ancient india〓 Now, regarding depriving of their monkhood of the mentally disordered monks at the assembly, and their later rehabilitation, i would compare this with the modern thinking of rehabilitation medicine for the disabled. Therefore, why did the vinaya allow an acquittal of the insane? The following is my view. the sangha would have been stocked with medi-cal, psychiatrical and legal knowledge about the mentally disordered. and also buddhist fundamental principles such as the doctrine of dependent origination and compassion would support this view. 1)mental disorders, mental illness, or psychiatric diseases.狂,顛狂,癡狂inchinese transla-t1on, 2)vin. iii,78.there is no offence if it was unintentional, if he did not know, if he were no neaning death, if he was out of his mind, a beginner.", horner, i. b.
