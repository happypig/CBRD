the japanese ssociation of Indian and buddhiststudies journal of indtiam ad budchist stdies vol.58, no.3, march( The background of huiyuan's philosophy: his Twofold interpretation of the "ten mysterious Gates" NAkanISHi Toshihide 1.Introduction Huiyuan慧苑(673?-743was a disciple of Fazang法藏(643-712), who was the third patriarch of the huayan Schoolin china. although huiyuan's philosophy has been studied extensively, a large portion of the preceding studies have focused on the differenc-es between the teachings of huiyuan, fazang and chengguan澄觀(738-83).little atten-tion has been paid to huiyuan's original thought and its background. in this paper, after surveying huiyuan's thought on the basis of his classification of a11 the doctrinal categories of buddhism, we focus on his original teaching, particularly, his twofold interpretation of the "Ten mysterious gates"(十玄門).This paper also discusses the background of his thought, which was infuenced by the awakening offaith F) and Fazang's personal interpretation of the aF. 2.four classes of Teachings In his writing the kamding ii(刊定記),huiyuan classifies a11 the doctrines of buddhisir into the following four classes of teachings: "erroneous teachings"(迷眞異執教),"quarte. teachings"(眞一分半教),"half teachings""(眞一分滿教),and "complete teachings""(眞具 分滿教).the four classes of teachings can be schematized as follows: (4)complete teachingstathagata-garbha Thought, huayan buddhism(華嚴教學) it is important to note that Huiyuan places the tathagata-garbha doctrine and huayan Buddhism in the same class(4).in this matter, we can consider that huiyuan reflected the changein zang's thought: in the latter half of his life, Fazang eventually recognized the  The japanese ssociation of indian and buddhiststudies 4)the background of huiyuan's philosophy (t. nakanishi) importance of the tathagata-garbha doctrine. This relation between the tathagata-garbha doctrine and huayan buddhism is one of the characteristics of huiyuan's philosophy andaprimary component of Chengguan's crit-icism. furthermore, it is closely connected with the background of the twofold doctrine of the ten mysterious Gates. 3.twofold interpretation of the "ten mysterious gates" afeature of huayan buddhism is that it gives a clear explanation of the metaphysica. visionin vairocana's intent contemplation, which is impossible to express by means of language. nonetheless, the doctrine of the ten mysterious gates which was expressed by Fazang aims to express this vision. there are some differences with regard to the names applied to the ten mysterious gates izang's writings, however, he remains consistent with this concept of the ten mysterious Gates, which is based on ten perspectives express. ing a worldview of the buddhoatamsakasutraas)-"the inexhaustible dependent co-arising""(無盡縁起). 〓n one hand, huiyuan's understanding of the ten mysterious gates is quite different from fazang's. he proposes a twofold concept for the ten mysterious gates -the "attri-butes"(徳相)and the "action"(業用).in the following paragraphs, we will consider the change in the concept of the ten mysterious gates. huiyuan subtilizes the fourth category (4)into two levels -the "non-obstruction between the absolute and the phenomenal""(理 事無〓)and the "non-obstruction between the phenomenal and the phenomenal"(事事無 〓)and attributes the bas to the latter. Inan attempt to amplify the content of the baSin the kanding ji, huiyuan applies a twofold concept of the ten mysterious gates, which he describes as follows podboanontcomropeierpeuniipsconstraigis ishesie tlc isiseiusynaies: 第七、顯義分齊者,於中有別、有通。別,謂隨會、隨品、隨文句字等,一一皆有義分齊故 通,謂一部大宗義之分齊。今此所辨,唯通非別,謂即事事無〓法界宗中義之分齊爾。於 中二初辨相、後問答。前中三一體事、二徳相、三業用。初、體事者,即是徳、用所依, 此通二種。(〓-b) From this passage, it is clear that huiyuan elaborates the content of the basby divid-ing it into the following three categories: the "substance"(體事)," attributes", and "action." This interpretation is distinct from those advanced by azang and his master zhiyan智儼 〓8)in their commentaries on the baS. however, in tetms of the names like the  the japanese ociationof Indian and buddhist studies above three and the structure of the thought -he metaphysical concept can be divided into three categories based on abstract logic, we can suppose the three great fundamentals in the aF-"substance"(體),"characteristics"(相),and "function"(用).we may say that hui-yuan developed his interpretation in the context of the af. Next, we consider the content of the twofold ten mysterious gates in concrete terms. In the kanding ji, huiyuan explains the element of "attribute"' as follows 、徳相者,謂相即、相在等由佛菩提無染依止,莫不皆以眞如爲體。眞如〓具過恒沙徳, 眞所起事徳量亦然。是故此事徳相一同眞性,無〓自在。(x29a) 第二、徳相者,第八迴向説眞如一百門徳皆名眞如相。又《起信論》云"眞如相大者,具 足無量性功徳故。"此徳即是相,名徳相也。今此將顯如所起果故,以如徳而名其果。(x05 42b-4a It is clear from the passage that Huiyuan describes the " non-obstruction between phe-nomena and phenomena" by the logical structure of the tathagata-garbha doctrine. he clearly states that the substance of the " attribute"" is suchness (tathata眞如)and explains that this non-obstruction is effected through the medium of the merits of the suchness, ad-ditionally, looking at its content, as is the case with Fazang's ten mysterious Gates, the "attribute" describes the worldview of the bas The latter clarifies that huiyuan intends to explain the vision of vairocana's enlighten-ment -described as the " attribute," for which he refers to the translation of the basin eighty juan八十華嚴(t10160b) and the af(t32575c)- the basis of not only the BAS but also the aF. Huiyuan explains the concept of "action""(業用)as follows. 三、業用者,謂佛菩提證得淨法界故,成就通明、三味、解脱,而能於彼染、淨體事示現 自在相作、相入等。(x0529a) 第三、業用中二.先、通顯所因,後、別辨其相。前中謂佛、菩薩成就無〓法界相應三味、 通明、解脱、陀羅尼等用。前體事對應度者轉變自在,此所轉境通於染、淨。(x46a) Here, he states that after having achieved enlightenment, buddha and the bodhisattvas adapt themselves according to those they have to save, and their actions in response to both impure and pure pervade both sides, the focus of  action"" is the blessing of the buddha and the bodhisattvas. other noteworthy features of huiyuan's twofold intetpretation of the ten mysterious Gates are as follows. although no evidence is available, it can be inferred from the concept  the japanese ssociationof indian and buddhiststudies 6)the background of huiyuan's philosophy (t. nakanIShl) of " attributes"built on the " greatness of the attributes of suchness""(相大)-that huiyuar describes the " action" as the "greatness of the activities of suchness"(用大).〓n the other hand, inf, the "greatness of the activities of suchness" is of two kinds. The first is " per-meation through manifestation of the essence""(自體相熏習).This permeation depends on good nature, which is inherent in the minds of a11 living creatures. the second is " perme-ation through the external intluence of suchness"(眞如用熏習).such permeation depends on buddhas' blessings. As stated above, huiyuan consistently applies this " greatness of the activities of the suchness"" as the " permeation through external intluences", to his interpretation, which is basedoazang's commentary on the treatise yiii(義記). In the yiii, Fazang comments as follows: 用大者,謂隨染業幻、自然大用,報、化二身龜、細之用,令諸衆生始成世善、終成出世 故也。下文顯之。何故唯言善不云不善者,以不善法違眞故,是所治故,非其用也。若爾 諸不善法應離於眞。釋云以違眞故,不得離眞,以違眞故,非其用也。(<ref><canon>T</canon><w>4a</w></ref> according to this comment, different from the primary meaning of the aF, Fazang re-stricts the "greatness of the activities of suchness"" to the "reward body"(報身)and the "transformation body"(化身)in the stage of attainment, and inteiprets it as a blessing in this stage. That is, the " action" that huiyuan defends is based on this interpretation of Fazang. l addition, the " attribute" describing huiyuan's worldview of the baS concurs with Fazang's Ten mysterious gates. The " action", however, is a concept newly created by hui-yuan, and herein lies his originality. namely, huiyuan thought a great deal about buddha's blessing and added its aspects to the ten mysterious Gates 4.conclusion we have considered the twofold ten mysterious Gates. Huiyuan developed the concept of e action"(業用)in the context of the af and Fazang's commentary. The other concept of " attribute""(徳相)is based on the "greatness of the attributes of suchness""(相大),in conclusion, the twofold ten mysterious Gates is based on the doctrine of the af and Fa-zang's interpretation of it. Furthermore, we may say that the twofold ten mysterious Gates, which is the basis of huiyuan's thought, is largely attributable to the af. addition-ally, as opposed to fazang's ten mysterious gates, which expresses a world-view of the BAs, Huivuan's twofold ten mysterious Gates includes the aspect of the buddha's bless-  the japanese ssociationof indian and buddhis studies The background of huiyuan's philosophy (t. nakaniSh) ing. we can consider the inclusion of this aspectin the ten mysterious Gates to be huiyu. a's original contribution. The bias of placing great importance on the af, as is the case with the four classes of teachings, huiyuan foregrounded the change inzang's thought, however, huiyuancon-structs his thought built oF, and lays more emphasis on the af than did Fazang. Fur-thermore, as previous studies have pointed out, the thought of wenchao文超,who was also one of Fazang's disciples, is influenced by fazang's interpretation of the a3), particularly, the two aspects of suchness-immutable and mutable"(不變・隨縁).Thus, af had a greater influence on scholars of Huiyuan and wenchao's generation. Thus, it is no exagger-ation to say that the logical structure of huaya buddhism of the time was greatly subiect to af. In addition, to better understand the factor of this bias, without being overly con-cerned about the framework created after the time of the huayan Schoolichina. itis nec-essaty to examine not only the literature of huayan buddhism but also the buddhist litera-ture of huiyuan's time.
