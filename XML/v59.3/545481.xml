the japanese association of Indian and buddhist studies on the Lhasa Manuscript of Satasahasriko prainaporamito DeNiyaYE Pannaloka 1.Introduction As far as can be ascertained, the Lhasa manuscript (S(S)l) and the kyushu university manuscript (S(S)kd),of the Sanskrit versions of the satasahasrika prajnaparamita dvitiyakhand (S(S)〓), are in palm-leaf form. other S(S)〓 manuscripts are preserved n paper.1〓 since 2009,the s(S)lis accessible online at the homepage of the research [nstitute of Sanskrit Manuscripts and buddhist literature peking university.) The S(S)〓 manuscript is probably older than the s(S) kd manuscript. Neither of these important manuscripts have been studied in detail to date. n initial step is taken in the following pages towards a brief and preliminary introduction to the S(S)l. The original S(S)l was formerly available at the ethnic library, beijing, after it was brought from tibet with other sanskrit manuscripts in96.4)it is currently kept in the museum of Lhasa in tibetan autonomous Regionar) after it was returned to lhasa from beijing in993. 2.nature of Lhasa manuscript rISMBl gives the lhasa Ms. the title"《十万頌般若経》梵文写本(原民族宮蔵梵文 写本第1号)satasahasriko prainaparamita collection of Sanskrit Mss. formerly pre-served in the china Ethnic library, no.1)." The name of the manuscript is given on the first folio 1),as "xXIx satasahasrik prainaparamitoa (ch.12-16), (hand-written in modern devanagari letters).) The lhasa Ms. has 280 folios in total. Each folio generally comprises seven lines. two spaces ofeight characters are left for string holes. although the Lhasa Ms. is now online, some folios have been placed in the wrong order or have been given the wrong folio number. For example, folio nos.041a and041b appear  The japanese associatioof Indian and buddhist studies online in reverse order. The Ms. itself, however. is numbered in the correct order. The last four folios are again in the wrong order.(一号之四,(33)277-28 and(34)277b 〓80b).The leaves 278,279and8are in reverse order in the present array. The correct order should be2727272727277b.the folios should each be given their correct folio numbers and those folio numbers should then be placed in the correct order following leaf no.137b(S(S) ed., il-2,p.71,in.5). The lhasa Ms. is a well preserved Ms. with its leaves ina better condition than those of the kyushu university kyudai) Ms. The letters are neatly written and the meaning is easily ascertainable in most cases. Though omissions and repetitions exist, more often than not, these omissions and repetitions are noted and corrected within the text. although oc-casional omissions are seen, the lhasa ms. contains the least number of omissions among a11 dvitiyakhanda manuscripts. The style of letters indicates its affnity to the proto-bengali-cum-proto-maithili script which paleontologists date to somewhere between the 11nd1 centuries. hence, we can assume that the origin of the Lhasa ms. can be dated to the period during or prior tc the 1century. 3.Contents The28 folios of the Lhasa ms contains the text of ch.12dvads parivarta), ch.13 (trayodasaparivartbhutiparivarta]),ch.14caturdasaparivartkr pari-laria]),ch.1(pancadasaparivarta) and the early part of ch.16odasaparivarta) ofs (S)〓. First dvadasaparivarta has a unique opening salutation as " namah sri candamaharosan-aya." instead of paying homage to a11 buddhas and bodhisattvas (srva-buddha-bodhisat-tvebyah)as common to the prainaparamita class of texts and manuscripts the copyist of the lhasa Ms. pays homage to the deity named candamaharosana. the opening and clos-ing sentences of each chapter are as follows. The salutation at the beginning of ch.12reads. "namah si candamahorosanava. Then the text begins: prthipidhatv-sattaya dyusman saradyatiputra purvantato bodhisattvo nopaiti. prthividhatu-sunyataya purvantato bodhisattvo nopaiti .. " (01b).ch12ends with: " satasahasryh prajnaparamitoych paripartto dvadcsah." (b).ch.13(subhuti parivarta) begins: "ath ayusmn saradvatiputra ayusmantam subhutim etd avocat."  〓he japanese associationof Indian and buddhisstudies (〓0b3) and ends with: " satasahasryah prajnaparamitayah subhuti parivarttah trayodasah."157a7).ch.14akra parivarta) begins: "atha khalu yavantas trisahasre mahasahasre lokadhatau maharojus te sarve aneka devaputra-koti-niyuta-sata-sahasraik sarddham tattraiva parsadi sannipatita abhuvan." (157a') and ends with "satasahasrya praijnaparamitoya dvitiyakande caturdasaparivarttah smaptah."(197b3)ch.15begins "atha khalu tes devaputranam etd abhut." (7b3) and ends with "satasahasryah prajnaparamitaych pancadasamah parivarttah."(26b4).ch.16begins: "atha sakrasya devanamindrasyaitad abhut."(26b4) and ends (halfway) with: "punaraparam kausika bodhisattvena mahasattvena prajnaparamita na rupad gavesitavya nanyatra rupad gavesitavya, na sabdud gavesitavyo."(276b8). Except for the absence of a few folios, the lhasa Ms. is a complete manuscript of the original text it transcribes. in contrast, the kyudai ms. is missing a greater number of foli-os. in reading dvitiyakhandain the light of the lhasa ms. and kyudai ms., we observe that the new nepalese Manuscripts and kimura ed. (which seems to be mainly based on the new nepalese Manuscripts) contain a considerable number of mistranscriptions. These nanuscripts dating to 1orcenturies also contain idiosyncratic deficiencies that ofter hinder the flow and understanding of the text. The two olar-leaf Manuscripts given here (presumably both belonging to the period prior to the1century) provide the more accu. rate readings. again, the older manuscripts tend to be more consistent with the text con-tainedin bore jing大般若經初會(<ref><canon>T</canon><w>220</w></ref>)[S(c], shes rab kyi pha roltu phyin stong phrag brgyp, (TP no.730)[S(c)],大般若經第二會(<ref><canon>T</canon><w>220</w></ref>)[c)], shes rab kyi pha roltu phyin stong phrag myi shu lngTP no.731)[(c)1]and (TTP no.5188)[p(c)2].nevertheless, these older manuscripts too contain omissions, repetitions and mistranscriptions. in some cases, however, the Lhasa ms. preserves the original reading better than the kyudai Ms. The kimura ed. is the only printed versionof s(S)i. nevertheless, in my view, S(S)〓 ed. ought to be re-edited in the light of the older materials contained in its chinese and ti-betan translations, and, the Lhasa and the kyudai Manuscripts.
