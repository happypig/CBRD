discerning the original language of the TibetanVersions of Mahayana SutrasFrom a Simple Mistake in the idem kar ma Regarding theaiatasatrukaukrtyavinodhanasutraMIYazAKI Tensho1introductionAn excellent historiographer may sometimes make a mistake. once the error iscompiled in an influential catalogue, it can long be accepted as historical fact, in-deed until it is noticed and corrected. The account of the aiatasatrukaukrtyavinodh-anasutrakv given under the caption of "Mahayana sutras translated fromChinese" in the idem kar , one of the oldest and the most authoritativeTibetan catalogues of buddhist canonical scriptures, is most likely to be one sucl〓aSe,
What strikes us first about the understanding of the origin of the tibetan ver-sion of the akv is the discrepancy found between the dk and the 'pang than m(Pt))The two are almost contemporary (around the first half of the 9th century),but unlike the dk, the pt classifies the sutra among "sutras translated fromIndian."3)Since there seems no doubt that both catalogues refer to the same extant〓kv, composed of five fascicles, the truth will lie either in the account of the dk orin that of the pl. to examine which account is more credible, this paper will dis-cuss the subiect from the following three viewpoints: first, what the colophon sug-gests, second, what Chinese materials suggest, and third, the use of relatives irTibetan translations.2What the colophon suqqestsThe colophon of the akvmentions two scholars as those engaged in the translatiorof the sutra: Maniusrigarbha, an indian monk, and Ratnaraksita, a tibetan monk re-ferred to in the Sgra sbyor bsam po gnyis pa.4) neither scholar leaves any sign ofhaving translated material from chinese scriptures. given that specialists wellversed in Chinese buddhist scriptures were obviously needed in the projects involv-ing translation of sutras from chinese, the extant Tibetan version is therefore clearly
discerning the original language of the Tibetan versions ofMahayana Sutra (T. MIyazki)not taken froma Chinese original.3What chinese Materials suqqestsince each of the extant three chinese versions of the akv, i.e. the asheshi wangiing阿闇世王經(T626),the wenshuzhili puchao sanmei iing文殊師利普超三昧經(t627), and the weicengyou zhengfa iing未曾有正法經(T628), shows no literal agree-ment with the extant Tibetan version, we are left with the possibility that either the〓k is erroneous or, if the record is in fact correct, that the text mentioned in the dould represent a missing chinese version of the sutra. The kaiyun shijiao lu開元釋教録(t2154,730CE), in fact, argues that "the akvhas three extant versions andthree missing versions."5)with whatever little certainty we attach to this source, itcannot be completely denied that the sutra referred to by the dk may have beermmong these three missing versions. In addition, there is another possibility that apecific text translated into local, vernacular chinese, thereby escaping the attentionof the compiler of the chinese catalogue,6) might have been made use of by tibetarscholars and listed in the dk.However, how should we examine such a possibility that "an extant text" couldhave been translated from "a missing text?" The examination of the description inthe dk conducted thus far has involved no more than circumstantial observations,and we will remain in a fog unless we change viewpoints. we will now move on tcthe third, and final, perspective that points to "the style of translation" as direct evi-dence of the original form of the sutra.4 the use of Relatives in tibetan translationsone of the most effective indices with regard to "style" to distinguish Sanskrit fronChinese is the use of relatives; Sanskrit has highly developed relative structures thatare completely lacking in Chinese. tibetan translators, while originally unfamiliaiwith the use of relatives but later introducing them through the process of transla-tion from Sanskrit, felt the right to adopt a different style of translation in terms ofa relative structure in accordance with the stylistic differences of the original texts.The use of relatives can effectively function as the method for discerning the origi-nal of Tibetan translations.7) However, given the complete lack of philological stud-ies on this theme, a couple of examples will be shown by quoting from theMahayana sutras before proceeding to examine the case of the dkv

As one ofthese examples, we enumerate here "relative clause of time", e.g. "gang gyi tshe-
discerning the original language of the Tibetan versions ofMahayana Sutra (T. MIyazakI)de'i ishe" or "amziei ishe," common phrases corresponding to "-〓da" in translations from Sanskrit originals. Probably for the reason that this struc-ture, when translated, is difficult to retainin chinese, the lack of its appearance canbe used as an index that suggests the original should be chinese. An ideal examplefor this case can be drawn from the Suv, which has two tibetan translations, onefrom Chinese and another from Sanskrit, as shown belowSkt yad samudrika navah sayantrah sapatakikah/sthalam aruhya gaccheyus tda dhatur bhavisyatiSkt > ib  m zhig rgya mtsho'i gru bo che / 'khrul 'khor dang ni gyor mor bcas/thang l byung ste 'gro ba e'i tshe ring bsrel yod par gyur/t655假令大船舶盛滿諸財實能令陸地行方求佛舍利Chibl te gru chen thams cd/or dng rin chen rb bkang ste//thang bu skam l'gro us n/bcom ln ring bsrel bisal bar 〓ya)In the extant Tibetan translation of the akv, there are many kinds of relative struc.tures, one of which is "the relative clause of time" as mentioned in d. it will suf-fice to quote here an example from Sanskrit fragments fortunately preserved in theSchoyen collections.16)Skt yada ca maitreyena bodhisatvena bodhih prapta bhavisyati tatra esa punar eva tatassahayam lokadhatau upapadyisyati akhyatavi(Tib gang gi ishe na byang chub sems pa sems dpa' chen po byams pa byang chub mngo,par rdzogs par ishang rgya 'gyur bar 'gyur p dei ishe yang()byang chub sems pcsems pa chen po mi gyo ba zhes bya bar gyurro)5Conclusions
The conclusions reached above were that, first, the colophon suggests that the trans.lators of the extant akv had no involvement in the projects translating fromChinese texts, second, the existing chinese ajkv shows no literal agreement withthe tibetan versions, and third, the distinctive condition of Chinese originals lack-ing the clause of time is not satisfied by the extant akv. Thus, the classificationemployed by the pt that must be correct and it is highly likely that the compiler ofthe dk made a simple mistake in recording the name of the sutra.
