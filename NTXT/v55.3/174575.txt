1.Ivedic ritual, raksases attack the sacrifices, and are finally expelled by thesacrificers or priests.2) Though we often come across such a scene, especially in theblack Yajur veda Samhitas, it is not clear what the raksases really are. Therefore, Ihave extracted the words identified with rdksases in order to determine their substance. These words are categorised into the following four groups[〓]Abstract nouns(a) amati (thoughtlessness) [pl.] and arati (hostility) [pl.l]Ts5.1.5.9(b)amati (thoughtlessness) and durmati (malice)TS5.4.6.2(c) arati (hostility) [p.l] Ts11..6.18.3;6.2.10;1.25.,13.1., vs17ab; Sb1.1.2.2[sg.] kS12.7,1.(29)MS1.1.21),1.1.4(12.)(d) dvesas (hatred) [pll]tS63e4(e) nastrd)(destruction) [pl.] sb1.2.3,3.6.1.;38.see3-2,3;6.3.3.24;7.3.2.573.2.117.1.33-34:8.6.1.15(f)papman (evils.4.21,732.73.2.11[2]Hostile beings(a)bhratrvya (enemy) kS24.(93〓37.(1981)see3-1, kS25.9(1151see3-2;kS2510(118.1),2(127.10),26.5(127.10)(b)yo aratiyati (who has hostile intentions)KS2(se3-1, kS212(17.2-3)〓see3-2:MS12.1(19.16),3.8.8(10see3-2(c) yo sma dvesti yamc vayam dvismd (who hates us and whom we hate)TS6.18.46.2.1.26.3see2[3]Compounds with asuraThey are found in the brahmanas.4)〔4]praheti (weapon) vs15.16;kS17.9(2kas2681105),MS2.8.10(114.15),TS44.3.1
The raksases as praheti do not belong to enemies, but are regarded as the weap-ons against the enemies.Among these[] and[2]should be noted.[]a)(b) and (c) are negative emotions.and (e) and (f) are found in satapatha brahmana (SB). So far it seems the raksasesare connected with emotions such as aratis (hostility-not favourable) and amatis(thoughtlessness) in the black Yajur veda Samhitas. however, the connection be.tween these words and the raksases is not strong enough, because these words arementioned only in the mantras and regarded as raksases in the brahmana portionsAnd it is not clear whether the negative emotions are directed toward the sacrifices,devas or sacrificers (priests). Regarding this point,[2」(c) is more concrete in that yosman dvesti yam c vayam dvismd' is connected with the raksases. Therefore, inthis paper I wish to examine Otaittiriya Samhita (Ts) 6.1.8.3-4,②6.2.10.1-2;③6.3.9.2-3. first, the relationship between these three and the original mantras(lm)ts 1.2.5.lde5),(2m1.3.1.lbc6),(3m1.3.9.2ik7) dealt with should be clarified.Second, these three will be compared with the corresponding sentences in the otherYaiur Veda texts. Last, i will examine the other sentences that contain the mantrapo smian dvesti yamc vayam dvismd'2.the relationship between OTs 6.18.3-4,②6.2.10.1-2;③6.3.9.2-3 and theoriginal mantras is as follows:mts 12..lde, (2m.3.1.lbc idm ahm raksaso griva api krntamil sma dvestivamc vayam dvismd idmy griva api krntamiThus I cut the neck of the raksas. Thus I cut the neck of him who hates us and whom wehate.

There are twopersons, one whom he hates and one who hates him, verily successively he cuts their necks.(〓ts139.2ik iidm ahm rakso 'dhamm tamo nayami yo 'smadvesti yamc vamdvismd idom enmadhamm tmo nayamThis raksas here l lead to the lowest darkness. 〓him who hateth us and whom we hate, heliiml lead to the lowest darkness
〓Ts63.9.2-3im aham rakso 'dhamam tmo nayami yo sman dvesti yam c vayadvisma ity ha dvau vavi piirusau ym civ/vesti yais cainam dvesti idv ubhivad-hamam tmo nayati"This raksas here I lead to the lowest darkness, who hateth us and whom we hate, he says;here are two (kinds of) persons, he whom he[2]hates and he who hates him, both these heleads to the lowest darkness.In these brahmana portions, it seems the original two mantras are made one, andthe raksas is identified with yo 'sman dvesti yamc vayam dvismd, which is inter-preted as two persons. In order to detemine whether or not such interpretation iscommon, i will next examine the following corresponding sentences in the otherYaiur veda texts:①Kathaka Samhita(ks)24.4(93.1apisthala katha Samhita (kaps)37.5(198.8-21)9)
②KS25.9(115.1-1ps403(224.11-13),②Maitrayani Samhita (Ms)3.8.8(105.17-106.4),②SB3.6.1.4-5③sB38.2.14-1510)).The relationship between the corresponding sentences and the original mantras is as follows:mks2.(11.4-6),(2m2.12(17.2-3)idm aham raksaso griva apikrntamidam ahmo ssamano yo samano ratiyati tasya griva apikyntamiThus I cut the neck of the raksas. Thus l cut the neck of him who, equal to us or not equal.has hostile intentions.』』』

For the raksas is the enemy. it is the neck of theenemy that he cuts.(2mMs1.2.1(19.15-16)idm aham raksaso griva apikrntamidm ahm yo me samano ysamano ratiyati tasya griva dpikrntamiThus I cut the neck of the raksas.

Thus it is by means of the sacrifice that he drives awayhe destructionsl2). the raksases.In the corresponding sentences there is no yo 'sman dvesti yam c vayamdvismd.' note that kS and kapS identify the raksas with the enemy. As for themantra of kS and MS, idam ahm raksaso griva dpikrntami' is followed by 'idmaham yo nas (me) samano yo samano 'ratiyati tasya griva apikrntami, and MS3.8.8explains these two individually.From this it is found that only TS connects the mantra yo 'smavesti yam cvayam dvismd' with the raksas.4.In the other sentences that contain the mantra yo sm dvesti ymcvayndvismas.. or ym dvismo yis c no dvesti..' there are few cases in which the onewho hates us and whom we hate is identified with the enemy (ts3.5.3.1,MS4.110(13.4))or the competitor (MS1.5.11(79.19-80.4)).Araru (the name of the asuraraksas-see sb 1.417)appears in Ts11.9.1-2,MS1.1.10(6.3-8) and sb2..16-17. however, there is no identification, but just the factthat the location of the mention of araru in TS is nearer to the mantra than in MSand Sb

Although ts 6.3.2.2does not contain the mantra, the way of identifying the dve.samsi with the raksamsi appears similar to that of TS 6.1.8.3-4,6.2.10.-2,63.9.2-3.The relationship between TS63.2.2and the original mantra is as follows:rS13.Rveda (rv)8.79.3tvam soma tanukrhyo4)dvesobhyo 'nyakrtebhya urui yantisi varitha svaha.Thou, o soma, art the giver of wide protection from hostility, brought about by ourselves orby others; haill!〓』』
TS6.3.2.2
tvm soma tanukydbhya ity aha tanuky hy e dvesobhyo 'nyakrtebhya ity ahanyakrtani hiraksmsi
"Thou, o soma, brought about by ourselves,' he says, for he is the one who brings about byhimself, 'from hostility, brought about by others, he says, for the raksases are brought aboulby others.
The corresponding sentences are kS26.2,kapS40,MS3.9.1 and SB3.3.2-21,among which only MS and Sb mention the above mantra. In MS3.9.1(112.8-9)ianukrdbhyo dvesobhyo 'nyakrtebhya' is interpreted as yad eva tanuikriam canyaky-lm cinas tad etendvayajati"' (it is the evil which is made by ourselves or by others thathe wards off); in TS6.3.2.2tanukrdbhyo dvesobhyo 'nyakrtebhya' is divided into【wo and tanukrdbhyo' is connected with the soma and avestobhyo 'nyakytebhya' isidentified with the raksases.5. conclusionIn TS 6.1.8.3-4,62.10.1-2,6.3.9.2-3,the original two mantras are regarded as ifone mantra, and the raksas is identified with yo 'sman dvesti yam c vayamdvismd.' Such interpretation is not found in the other texts.Moreover TS6.3.2.2divides the original one mantra into two, and identifies ha-tred with the rdksases.Hence one can say that in the black Yaiur veda Samhitas, where the raksases arejust vaguely connected with the negative emotions, TS is in a unique position in therespect that it tries to identify the raksases with hatred or persons who hate the sac-rificer or whom he hates.)due to limitations of space, I had to cut the utilised texts and their english transla-ons, which will be shown as a part of the extended paper at the first opportunity.
