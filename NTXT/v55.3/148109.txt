〓n Intention of the compilers of the suvarnaprabhasaExpressed and intimated in the drdha-parivartaSuZUkI Takayasu1.The aim of This Paper. a continuous verification of the hypothesisAs has been already illustrated in a series of previous studies,) the Suvarnaprabhas (utra of Golen ligh, 〓u) one of the Mahayana buddhist scriptures whichhas collected and demonstrated various doctrines and rites of both mundane andsupermundane levels, and has long had wide influence over the way of thinking andliving of Asians, seems to have been underestimated in some cases by the modernscholarly world with remarks such as "the suv is a mere miscellaneous medley ofdoctrines and rites" or "the features appearing in the suv represent either a token ofthe assimilation of buddhism into hinduism or a token of the depravity ofBuddhism."
In relation to this, the present author focusing attention on the complicated struc-ure of the suv and on the description in the caturmaharaja-parivarta,3) has, partlupported by some archeological results,4) already proposed the following hypothesison one of the intentions of the compilers of the suv:<The hypothesis) owing to the account of the suv which has, through the severaltages of its formation, collected and demonstrated various doctrines and rites of bothmundane and supermundane levels already expounded in the treatises either of Mahayanaof non-Mahayana, or of non-buddhism ., of Hinduism) before, the compilers and theproponents of the suy became more able to lead their daily religious lives, including theiipractice of various rites and their attainment of various religious merits, in accordancewith "the teaching of the suy," that is, "the teaching of [Mahayana] buddhism." we cartherefore interpret the features appearing in the suv not as a token of "the assimilation ofBuddhism into hinduism" or "the depravity of buddhism," but as an attempt of buddhiststo survive in the indian religious world by emphasizing the value, the usefulness, and thecompleteness of [Mahayana] buddhism to the proponents under circumstances where hin-

Moreover, if one of the intentions of the compilers of the suy lies in this attempby collecting as many doctrines and rites as possible, however mundane or supermundanethey might be, from the stage of the formation of the suvcl to that of the suvc3 consistently, we might be able to suppose that the intention of the compilers has remained unchangedall through the stages of the formation of the suv. furthermore, it might turn out that theSuv is not "a mere miscellaneous medley of doctrines and rites," but a collection of thenwhich is intrinsic to the value of the suv.This paper continuously verifies this hypothesis by examining the drdha-parivari (chapter on the Earth-goddess drdha; chapter 185)of the suv), which is thefourth chapter in "the Five chapters on the various Gods and Goddesses."6)〓a brief survey ofthe drdha-parivarta (chapter on the earth-goddess drdha; chapte〓
18)
We will begin with a brief survey of the drdha-parivarta by dividing it approxi-mately into five sections (from 〓l to 〓5).〓l: The earth-goddess Drdha(堅牢地神)makes an address in the presence of theLord Sakyamuni as follows:when the suv is being expounded, the earth-goddess Drdha, together with her retinue.will become stronger and more powerful. in their bodies there will be produced greatpower, fortitude, and strength. having gone up to the seat of the law with invisible body,she will lean with her head upon the soles of the feet of the monks, nuns, laymen and lay-women who are preaching the suv. after having been satisfied with the nectar juice of theSuv and having obtained great brilliance and strength, she will cause to increase the savolof the earth and make the earth stronger so that the various fruits and crops will be strong.er, more tasty and greater. All those beings that are dependent upon the earth will findincrease and become great. having become great, they will enjoy the various enioymentand plcasures on earth such as various foods, drinks, and nourishment, these and similarvarieties of blessings existing on the earth and dependent upon the earth. For this reasonall beings should show gratitude to her by means of listening to respectfully, honoring, andworshipping the suv. by the hearing of the Suy they will have escaped from evil statesuch as hell and will have gained rebirth among gods and men in future time.wherever the various beings in various regions on the earth tell one another even a

The various savors of theearth will increase for all the beings in those regions of the earth. all those beings willbe blessed and will have great wealth and enjoyment. They will be devoted to liberality〓anadhimuktani ca bhavisyanti). They will have faith in the Three jewels of buddhism(trisu ratnesv abhiprasamnani bhavisyanti). (See Emmerick [1996:53-56))〓2:The Lord Sakyamuni tells the earth-goddess drdha the merits of hearing andhonoring the suv: whatever beings may hear even a single verse from the suv, theywill transmigrate from this world of men and will be reborn among the groups ofgods. whatever beings may honor the suv by adorning their houses and coveringthem with even a single umbrella or a flag, those adorned houses will becomedivine palaces made of the seven jewels. And when those beings transmigrate fronthis world of men, they will be reborn in those divine palaces seven times and will1experience inconceivable divine blessings. (See Emmerick [1996:56-57])〓3:The earth-goddess drdha makes a vow to protect the preachers of the SuyShe will dwell in those regions of the earth where the preachers of the suv have saupon the seat of the Law, and with invisible body she will lean her head upon thesoles of the feet of them so that the Suv, for the welfare of all beings, may long goforth in this world, so that beings may hear the suv, so that they may in future timeexperience inconceivable divine and human pleasures (anagate 'ahvany . acintyan,divyamanusyakani sukhani pratyamubhaveyuh), so that they may meet Tathagatas (tatha-gatasamavadhanagatas ca bhaveyuh), so that they may in future time awaken to su.preme and perfect enlightenment (anagate 'ahvany amuttaram samyaksambodhinabhisambudheram), and so that all the woes of hells and so on may be wholly cut offsarvanaraka-tiryagyoni-yamalokaduhkhami catyantena samucchinnani bhaveyur).(SeeEmmerick [199657])The first Chinese version suvcl rendered by Dharmaksema(曇無識)in the 5thcentury(412-421),the second Chinese version Suvc2 combined by Bao-gui(寶貴)ir597,the Sanskrit text suvs, and the smaller Tibetan version suvti conclude chapter18with the end of this section.〓4: This 〓4and the next〓5 only exist in the larger tibetan version suv72 and the

Then she adds instructionsin another two spells that enable the beings to meet her and to be blessed by her.after these instructions she concludes her address insisting that her power ofprotection and blessing originates in the Three Jewels of buddhism (ss rgyas dkonmchog n chos dkon mchog n dge 〓un dkon mchog, *buddharatna-dharmaratnasamgharatna).〓5: the Lord offers congratulations to the earth-goddess Drdha who protects theSuv together with its preachers, and prophesies that she will obtain inconceivablemerits by her act of protection.The structure of Chapter 18can be tabled as followsTable l.

SuzUki)3.the intention of the compilers of the suvarnaprabhasa expressed and intimatecin the drdha-parivartaHaving taken a brief overview, let us now return to the successive verification othe above-mentioned hypothesis by examining this drdha-parivarta, paying carefulattention not to overlook the intention of the compilers of the Suv expressed andintimated in this chapter.First, almost all of the religious merits this chapter l8 refers to are not the onepeculiar to buddhism but nothing other than those merits which are mundane ancpopular in india. The merits of hearing and honoring the suv are, for example, toincrease the savor of the earth, to make this circle of the earth moist with the moissavor of the earth, to make the earth stronger so that the various plants and treeswill grow stronger, to make all the various fruits and crops grow stronger, more fra-grant, more tasty and greater so that those beings who have enjoyed those variousdrinks and foods will increase their longevity, strength, complexion, and senses, tchave great wealth and enjoyment, to escape from hell, the region of animals and theworld of ghosts, and in future time to gain rebirth among gods and men. In contrast.only a few of the supermundane merits regarded as intrinsic to buddhism are listed.The minority exceptions in this chapter 18should be at the most to meet Tathagatasand to awaken in future time to supreme and perfect enlightenment. This tendencyremains unchanged in the second and last stage since the merits attained byemploying the several spells are such as to obtain prosperity, health, and longevity,and to be protected against enemiesSecond, suggested by the description in sl, there is high possibility that thehearers or the proponents of this chapter the compilers of the suv had expected arehose who were engaged in agriculture. to take some examples that reinforce thisassumption, the beings who should be blessed by the earth-goddess Drdha aredescribed as "those beings who are dependent upon the earth (stvani prthivisamnisritani, Suvs 124.4), as those beings who "will perform the various numeroushundreds of thousands of activities on earth nanavidhani prihivigatany anekan,nanavidhani karyasatasahasrani karisyanti, Suvs 122.13-14)," and as those beings who"will do acts that have to be done with power (balakaraniyani karmani karisyanti, suvs123.1)"on top of that, belief in "the earth-goddess" or "the spirit of the earth" that

Suzukl)(69brings about fertility is in general a very common one any time and anywhereamong farmers. There seems thus considerable validity for this assumptionAgricultural areas in india are said to have been very concerned about conventionalities, and the same is true of religious tradition, that is, in agricultural areas irIndia Hinduism has been predominant over buddhism. if one of the intentions ofthe compilers of the suv, as proposed in the hypothesis, lies in an attempt to survivein the religious world of India by emphasizing the value and the usefulness of[Mahayana] buddhism to these proponents, this Chapter 18(chapter on the Earthgoddess Drdha) may have been compiled for emphasizing the value and the useful-ness of the suv to those farmers in India who might have not been buddhists at thaime. This attempt was therefore, as it were, "to open up a new market." As well asthe characteristics pointed out above that almost all of the religious merits thisChapter 18 refers to are not peculiar to buddhism but popular and mundane, a de-scription in〓 suggesting that those people who should employ the spell for thewelfare and blessing do not necessarily need to be buddhists,8) may also serve tstrengthen this assumption and consequently the hypothesis.Third, in spite of the lack of laying stress of the merits intrinsic to buddhism, thevalue of the Three jewels (ie. the value of buddhism) is much emphasized andenhanced both in the first stage and in the second and last stage. what draw ou1attention here are the contexts in which the descriptions on the Three Jewelsappear.In(in the first stage) the description appears in the context that the beingswill have faith in the Three jewels and will be devoted to offering, since they havebecome blessed and had great wealth and enjoyment through the power of the earth-goddess drdha who was encouraged by one of the buddhist sutras named 〓uAnd in 〓(in the second stage) the description appears in the context that thosebeings who employ the several spells taught by the earth-goddess Drdha will beblessed and protected since she is always watched over by the Three Jewels so thatshe can grant the beings blessing and protection.0) it must be also noted that in thesecontexts Chapter l8 refers to the Three jewels, that is, buddhist monks and nuns aswell as the buddha and the Law.From these descriptions in the particular contexts, we can comprehend the inten-tion of the compilers of the suy as follows: "Since the beings will be blessed, will

Suzuki)have great wealth and enjoyment, and will be protected by the power of the earthgoddess drdha who is encouraged by one of the buddhist scriptures named suyand is always watched over by the three jewels of buddhism, it is highly expectedthat they will be willing to make a lot of offerings to the buddhall) or buddhistmonasteries, not to the hindu gods or brahmins."As has been pointed out in Suzuki [2006], buddhist monks and nuns who havetransmitted the law of the buddha and practiced for the supreme enlightenment,cannot accomplish their duty without any assistance, especially financial assistanceof lay people. Thus the hypothesis proposed by the present author appears quitereasonable, that one of the intentions of the compilers of the suy lies in their attemptto survive in the religious world of India by emphasizing the value and theusefulness of [Mahayana] buddhism to the proponents, by consistently collectingmany doctrines and rites all through the stage of the formation.4.A tentative conclusionlt is tentatively concluded here, from what has been said above, that with thecompilation of Chapter 18 referring to those religious merits which are mundaneand popular in India, the compilers of the suv must have attempted to emphasizethe value and the usefulness of the suv to the proponents, especially to thosefarmers in India who might have not been buddhists at that time, and also attemptedto attain financial aid from the proponents for the sake of accomplishing theirtransmittion of the law and religious practice for the supreme enlightenment.we can therefore say that the validity of the hypothesis has been strengthenedthrough the examination in this paper. however, its verification still needs to bestudied in further research.1)Suzuki, t.[1996]The Mahameghasutra as an origin of an interpolated Part of thepresent Suvarnaprabhasa, journal of Indid buddhist studies89(45-1),tokyo, pp8-30Suzuki, t.
