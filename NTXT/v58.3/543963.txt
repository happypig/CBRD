The japanese sSOciationof Indian and buddhistStudieS〓nksemendra's version of the pratihorysutraYaMasaKI kazuho1.IntroductionKsemendra (ca.990-1077a.d.) composed a buddhist narrative work bodhisattvbvadand-klpalato (hereafter av-klp).The fourteenth chapter of this work is devoted to the story ofmiracles (pratiharyasutra, hereafter prsu).1while Nakagawa[182]and okamoto[2-have analyzed and contrasted the versions of the prsu found in the Pali canon and Tibetantranslations, they do not consider ksemendra's version in their study. Focusing on kse-mendra's version of prsu, thus, this paper aims at showing which version of prsu ksemen-dra consults in composing his own version of prsu by comparing ksemendra's version oprsu and other versions.2.structure of prsuinv-klpbeforc proceeding to the central argumnent, it will be useful to outline the narrativeevents within ksemendra's prsuin sixty-one verses of the av-klp. The elements of prsu〓av-klp are as follows:(a) introductory verse (v.1)(b) heretics feel jealousy toward the buddha who is in high favor with king bimbisara and arepossessedby mara. (vv.2-6)(c) the heretics ask the permission of king bimbisara to conduct a contest of miracles against thebuddhas king bimbisara refuses it. (vv.7-9)(d) the heretics ask the permission of king prasenajit to conduct the contest, king prasenajitgrants it and asks the buddha to take part in the contest. (wv.10-28)(e) the story of prince kala. (vv.29)(f)king Prasenajit builds a hall for the contest ofmiracles. (v.41)(g)themiracle of the buddha causes a kapa-tree to shoot from the earth. (v.42)(h) the buddha emits a brilliant light from his bodv. (vv.4-46)(〓)the miracle of the buddha causes lotus-flowers to shoot ffom the earth and creates buddhas.

(j)gods praise the budcha. (vv.50-51)(k)The buddha preaches the law. (vv.52-54)(1)audiences give up the false notion of personality. (v.55)m) the heretics are overwhelmed by the power of the buddha's miracles and cannot work anymiracle. (v.56(n) Yaksa raises up the wind by which the heretics are swept away. (v.57)o) the buddha preaches that people should take refuge in the buddha, dharma, and sanga. (vv58-59)
p) the buddha converts the heretics and goes back to Rajagrha. (vv.60-61)3.classification of prsu versionsThe versions of prsu which i have taken into consideration are as follows:・divyavadana, chap.1: pratiharyasutra (divy) [ca.1oth century a.4・ula phreng ishegs kyi gzhi(tib),translated by vidyakaraprabha, dharmasribhadra, dpalbyor [ca.8-9th century a.d.・ken-pen-shuo-ji-ch eh-y-p-pi-nai-yeh-fsa-shih(根本説一切有部昆奈耶雑事),vol.26.translated by l-ching(義淨)[710a.d.・hsie-yii-ching(賢愚經),vol. 2, chap.14: chiang-liu-shih-pi in(降六師品),translated byHui-chueh(慧覚)[445a.・s-n-i(四分律),vol.51,translated by buddhayasas(佛陀耶舎)[408a.d.8・o-pen-hsing-ching(佛本行經),vol.4, chap.2 tai-shen-pien-pi in(大神變品),translatedby pao-yun(寶雲)[424-4d.・a-chi-p-yii-ching(法句譬喩經),chap.3 t-yi-pi in(地獄品),translated by Fa-chui andFa-li(法炬,法立)[209-306a..Fa-li(法炬,法立)[209-306d.1)jataka#483 sarabhamigaiatak[jataka#483 sarabhamigaiatak[・dhammapadatthakatha yamakappatihariyavatthu [ca.4ad.These versions are classifiedinto two basic groups MSV group (the texts which pertain to theMulasarvastivada tradition) and non-MSV group. nakagawa[1982]has already pointed outthat the versions of prsu in divy, tib and ken-pen-shuo-ji-chieh-y-p-pi-nai-yeh-fs-shih have nearly the same elements. They form the mSV group.Elements(,hj,1)m and (o) in ksemendra's text, as previously out-lined, are shared by other versions in the MSV group. while(,〓and (mare also common to the non-MSv group, (e) (divy13.22-155.11-2bt314-330c25),(1)(d48a6b2-4331c15-17),13)and (o) (divy164.7-16d523-6

This fact strongly suggests that ksemendraconsults prsu transmitted in the Mulasarvastivada sectin composing his version of prsu4.discrepancies betweenprsuin mSV adprsuinav-klpas shown above, ksemendra's version of prsu and the versions in the mSV group havesmany commnon elements. however, there are narrative elements that appear in mSv groupversions that are not included in ksemendra's version(〓)enumeration of Tathagatas" obligations.

The uapaneSe asSociation ofIndian and buddhist studieS〓v)the following substitutions are noted.instead ofelement(v),ksemendra's version of prsu has element (g), which is found in thepali versions (jatakc28-26,dhammapadatthakatha 18-207.14)and in the ver.sions in the psien-yi-ching11)and the ssu-9-7).14instead of elements (v), ksernendra's version has element (p), which is found irhe version in the Fo-pen-hsing-ching (21).15we can see that in his version of prsu. ksemendra omits the elementswhich theversions of the MSV group commonly have and that he replaces elementsv) withelements found in the versions of prsu in the non-MSv group. it is significant that kse-mendra is familiar with the prsu transmitted by the versions of the non-mSV group. it isnot unusual for ksemendra to embellish his retelling of stories transmitted in the the mula-sarvastivada sect with stoty elements derived in consultation with non-MSv versions,which is seen in other chapters of av-klp.165.conclusion
(1)ksemendra's version of prsu contains a majority of elements which are commonto the versions in the mSV group. This shows that ksemendra consults the prsutransmitted in the mulasarvastivada sect.(2)however. ksemendra's version of prsu contains a few elements which are notfound in the versions of the mSV group or contains elements which have been re-placed with non-MSV elements.(3)the main source of ksemendra's version of prsu is undoubtedly the prsu trans-mitted in the mulasarvastivada sect. but it is important to note that ksemendra isaware ofprsu as narated in the versions of the non-mSV group. ksemendra doesnot intend simply to rewrite prsu transmitted in the Mulasarvastivada sect. as apoet, he is takes liberty to make his story more compelling through narrative em-bellishnents of non-mSv origin.*My special thanks are due to dr. david mellins for correcting my english and giving many sug-gestions. i also wish to thank professor kiyoshi okano for providing me the copy of the tibetarblock print of the Fifth dalai lama (tohoku#7034).notes
