The  ujapaneSe sSOciationofIndian and buddhiStstudiesBhaviveka on the Yogacara theory of anyopohaTAMuRa Masaki0.The fifth chapter of the mudhyamakahrduyakarikoa is meant for opposing Yogacarasview of emptiness unyata) as the emptiness of hypostasized subject-object duality(grahyagrahakadvayasunya-dvayabhawa).according to the Yogacaras, empirical factors,characterized as a subiect oran object, are constructed through concepts and language andas such they exist only nominally or conventionally (abhilopamatra). therefore, empti-ness as conceived of by them is also defined as  emptiness of an effable intrinsic nature(abhilapyatmasunyatua).The present paper deals with mHkV60-68,in which bhaviveka, in order to disputethis view ofemptiness, has to argue against dignaga's apoha theory.1.In mHkV0bhaviveka presents the yogacaras" view of a word meaning and pointsout that, in formulating the principle that everything is ineffable, they are violating thesame principle.〓Hkv60 samanyam abhilapym hi samamyamn* kimcan / nabhilapyatmasunyatvm*〓ay mpapadppate //(*ca na] h, s, sg, ms, naca l1, l2, ec.**nabhilapyatmasunyatvam]l1,L,, S, sG,ms; nabhilapatmasunyatvam h, Ec)" [Yogacaras] Indeed, a universal (samanya) iswhat is to be denoted [bya word] abhilapya). but the universalis something indeterminable (limcana) [ie., something unreal]. [bhaviveka] if so, then it is not appropriate even to say that[the statement that all dharmas are] empty of an effable essential nature [is meaningful] b-hilapyatmasunyatva)."Bhaviveka says thatin the Yogacaras' view a universal is what is to be denoted by a word.In the lightof arguments presented in mHkv66,what is considered here to be a universals anyapoha.1 accordingly, bhaviveka brings in here the Yogacaras" view that anyapohais what is to be denoted by a word.The point is clear. if the Yogacaras argue that since a universal in the form ofanyapoha,which they hold to be what is to be denoted bya word, is unreal, what is denotedby a wordhas no essential nature, they cannot fommulate this principle, even if they did, the statement

Sincethe universal (tsya) exists as such [an effable] essential nature, it is not reasonable that [ the uni-versal] is ineffable."according to bhaviveka, what is to be denoted by a word is an entity qualified by a universal (samanyavad vastu).In his view what is understood froma word is such an entity. it isimportant to note that, as shall be shown, what bhaviveka considers here to be a universais not anyapoha but vijatiyehasunyatva  emptiness of a dissimilar entity' and that he holdsthe view because he considers that the wordgo cow, ' for example, must refer to any cowsand not to non-cows. it will be explained in MHKV63 how the qualifier universal is treat-ed as what is to be denoted by a word in this view. what is important is that in bhaviveka'sview the universal is not beyond verbalization and hence effable.2.2.mHkV2states that when he says that an entity qualified by a universal is what is tbe denoted by a word, he means the emptiness of a dissimilar entity by the "universal' andhat this emptiness has a claim to be regarded as a universal.MHkv6:vijatiyenasunyatuam hulyadhivrttihetutahsamamyat iulyaiatiye samanyam iti niscitam"Emptiness of a dissimilar entity [i.e., being different from a dissimilar entity-] is the universal, be-ause lthis emptiness is] the cause of the occurrence of the same cognitiontulyadhiprttihetu)This emptiness is] determined as a 'universal' by virtue of similar entities having itin common.According to bhaviveka, itis by virtue of the universal characterized by the emptiness ofadissimilar entity that different cognitions of the same form can occur with respect to indi-vidual entities of the same class.2.3.In bhaviveka's view, if an entity qualified by a universal is denoted by a word, then itnaturally follows that the universal is also denoted by a word.MHKv6nosrayasyagrahe grahyam samkhyovat tadgrahe grahot  tadvat kalpyam ato vastu va-cym cestamprthag na c*(*cestam prthag na ca」 h, s; nestam prthag bhavetl1,l2, ec, cestamprthag bhave sG, Ms)〓 [The universal in the form of emptiness of a dissimilar entity]cannot be

For, just like a number, it is grasped only when its locus isgrasped. and, [this being the case,] itis not accepted that [the universal is] separate from [the entity which has this universal] (prthak).accordingly, an entity qualified by the [universal] tatvavastn) is anobject of a conceptual cognition and a significand [of a word]."It is interesting that bhaviveka applies the anvaya-vyatireka method to establish the non-distinction between the universal in question and its holder. according to bhavivekathere does not exist the universal in question independently of the entity which possessesit, so that, when an entity qualified by the universal is denoted by a word. it must be saidthat the universal is also denoted by the word.3.now, in order to establish that an entity which is qualified by the universal in the formof emptiness of a dissimilar entity is denoted by a word, bhaviveka must explain about twcpoints: the first is that the emptiness of a dissimilar entity resides in all entities of the sameclass, in consequence of which the word go is usedto refer to any cows, the second is thatdifferent kinds ofemptiness of a dissimilar entity reside in one and the same entity. incon-sequence of which two different words, say, mila blue' and utpal lotus.' are used to referto asingle entity, a blue lotus.MHkV64abhedsattvadravyabhyam* ekato 'nekavripy**api / tadvinase vinasac ca nanyasmintammatir n*abhedasattvadravyabhyaml1, l,, ec, abhedasattvadravyabhyams, sG,ms,abhedadravyasattvabhyamh.m*ekato 'nekavrtty]l1,l2,h, s, SG, s; ekam anekavrtty ec)"fur-hermore, [the universal in question] exists as a single entity in many [individual] entities (ekatonekavrtti) since it exist [in individual entities ] as something undifferentiated (abhedusattva) andsince it is not a substance (adtravya).In addition, this universal does not perish when a substance"which is its locus ], perishes. For these reasons, it is not proper to say that the cognition ofthe uni-versal does not occur in another [substance]."MHkV65:anilanutpalabhinnarupenavyavadhanatah*samanadhikaranyam hi dvayor eka-rihavritith(*anilanutpalabhinna-]h, s, ec, anilanutpalabhinna-]l1, l,, anilanutpalam bhinna-SG,Ms) "indeed, [it is established that] two [such universals] have the same locus (samand-dhikaramya) since they can reside in one and the same entity. For they are not excluded from eachother (avyavadhana).[In the case of a blue lotus, for example, the two universals, being differentfrom non-blue (anilabheda) and being different from non-lotuses (anuppalabhedd), reside in thelue lotus] since [the blue lotus is] something which is differentiated from non-blue entities andfromnon-lotuses."according to bhaviveka, the emptiness of a non-cow which a certain cow possesses is sin-gle, resides in other cows, and does not perish even if the cow perishes. This will explainthe first point. Furthermore, emptiness of non-blue and that of anon-lotus do not contradict

point.
4.1. From the point of view of bhaviveka who holds that an entity qualified by a universalis denoted by a word, if anyapoha as conceived of by the Yogacaras had a claim to be auniversal, then it would have to be accepted that anyapoha is denoted by a word. but, inhis view, anyapoha cannot be treated as a universalMHkV66ab: manyapoho 'nyasamany anyadharmad* visesavat /-dharmad]l1,l2, h, s, ec-dhammau SG, ms)い[Thesis:][The universal called] anyopoha [of an entity] is not a universalcommonto] another entity; [Reason.] because it is aproperty differing from entity to entity; [Ex-ample:] like a specific property visesa).'As cow xexcludes non-x, so also does cowyexclude non-y.cow x is qualified by anyapo.hal and cowyby anyapoha2. in this case, if anyopohal were the same as anyapoha2, therthe two cows would be identical with each other. but if anvdpohal were different fromanya-poh2, these two anyapohas could not be a universal. This is what bhaviveka intends tosay by stating the argument.4.2.mHKV66cd is to discuss the case in which anydpoha that qualifies an entity is notdifferentiated fromamyapoha that qualifies another entity.MHIkV66cd: nabhavasyavisesatvad dhibhedah kambaladisuabsence (abhava) is not differen.tiated (visesa). consequently, one could not have different cognitions of entities such as a dewlapsince such entities are not differentiated from one another].?Ibhaviveka's view, anyapoha, as kumarila argues, consists in absence. That is, anyapo-ha amounts to anyabhawa absence of others,' or difference. a dewlap is qualified by anyd.pohal and a tail is qualified by anyapoha2. anyapohal and anyqpoha2 are the differencefromnon-dewlaps and that from non-tails. according to tj, absence has no essential nature(ngo bo nyid med pa,* nihsvabhava) and hence is something unreal.〓 These two anyapo-has are not differentiated from cach other in that both are unreal. if they were unreal, thenthe dewlap and the tail would become the same entity since the dewlap has no differencefrom the tail and the tail has no difference from the dewlap.44.3.recall that bhaviveka adopts the anvaya-vyatireka method to establish the non-distinc-tion between a universal and its holder. if a universal is grasped independently of an entitywhich is supposed to possess it, it follows that the universal is distinct from the entity.

Thus it follows that the anyupoha the Yogacarasconsider to be a universal which is distinct from its qualificand cannot be denoted by aword. in addition, if an entity which is not qualified by the anyapoha were denoted byaword through the anyapoha, then it would follow that the anyapoha is not denoted by theword.

The universal consists in emptiness of a dissimilar entity.Both the entity and the universal are real at the conventional level. when such a view isac-cepted, the yogacaras" theory of 〓emptiness of an effable intrinsic nature' cannot be ac-cepted.
It is to be noted that there is a variant reading of MHKv68ab. The Tibetan version ofMHKV68ab goes as follows:MHKV68ab (tib)denigzham gyi ngo bo  es na brjod med nyid mi rigs*syca bhinna-ripatvad vastuno 'nabhilopyato ))"if the [anyapohu] has an essential nature different from [thatof] a entity, in this case it is not reasonable that this [anyapoha] cannot be denoted by a word."If the Yogacaras argued that anyapoha is distinct from an entity which is supposed to have
The japanese association of Indian and buddhist Studiesit, it would have to be said that the property anyopoha has an essential nature differenfrom that of the entity, otherwise, no distinction could be made between the two. if the anvopoha, which the Yogacaras hold to be what is to be denoted by a word, had an essential na-ture, they could not maintain the theory of emptiness ofan effable intrinsic nature.'6.The following points have become clear:(1)bhaviveka considers that the theory otapoha is the Yogacaras' linguistic theory to account for their view of emptiness asemptiness ofan effable intrinsic nature.' (2)he defines amyapoha as a kind of universal(3)he tries to discredit the apoha theory within the frame of reference such that what isdenoted by a word must be an entity qualified by a universal. This leads him to discusshow anyapoha can be related to an entity.(4)what he means by the word vastu 'entity' isi essence an individual, referred to by the word dray 'substance' also. This is why, indenying the property of being a universal to anyapoha, he can treat anyapoha as somethinglike a specific property. (5)he regards anyapoha as 'absence of others' or 'differencefrom others.
Bhaviveka's arguments against the theory of apoha clearly show that in his view theworld in which verbalization takes place must have the conventional reality.dotes: 1)See also tj ad mHkv[215b6-216l, p23-6].2)for a full account of theanvaya-vyatireka method, see g. cardona, "oreasoning fromanvaya and vyatireka inarlydvaita," in studies ininichiosophyhmedabad:1981).3)see t [273242].4)See hattori [19753-4].<abbreviations) c: M.d. eckel, bhaniveka ad his buddhist opponemts (harvard universitypress. 2008).h p. hoomaert. 〓annotated Translation of hadhvamakahrdayakariko/arkaivd-〓v.5-68," religion ad culture132001)347.hattori[1975] study of the chapter orapoha of the mfimamsaslokavarttika"(in Japanese), nemoirs ofthe faculpy ofletters, kyotoUniversity-63.L1:ch. lindtner, " bhavya's madhyamakahrdaya (pariccheda five)Yogacaratattvaviniscayavatara," the adr librrybulletin(1995)37-65.L,:ch. lindtner,〓dhyamakahrdayamofbhavyThe adyar library and Research centre, 2001).MHk:〓adhyamakahrdayakarika, see Ms, SG,L1,l2, h, S, ec. s: a.
