1.IntroductionThe descriptions about omens or auspiciousness appear in various texts, and are impor.tant to understand the concept of the cosmology in ancient india. buddhism prohibited div-ination. while hinduism etc. possess the texts of divination and astrology as well as ritualmethods which control the effects brought by omens. Moreover, the thought of divinationis closely related to the kingship and plays an essential role in the indian culture from an-cient to modern period. Though the importance of the texts is well known, only few re-searches are made, and there is room for studying manuscripts to be done in this area.The word pap-is an important concept as the cause ofresults which omens bring about.The object of this paper is to reconsider the words, papa- and apacara-, andit also attemptsto clarify their positions among the texts of divination, including the result of the researchof the gargasamhita'slmanuscripts (MSS).2)2.The texts and the scopeThis paper deals with the following four texts:O The atharvavedaparisista (vparis)j0b,70c,②the brhatsamhita (brhsamh)45,The applicable chapters of the Matsya-purana (Matsyapur), and ①the gargasamhita (Gsamh)39.contents appeared in theGSamh might be earlier than the other three texts.4 hence the mSS of the GSamh is re-garded as the importance source. in addition, the adbhutasagara (adbhuas) and the adbhu-tadarpana (adbhutad) are used for the supplementary information for the correspondingpassages in the MSS.In these chapters. the causes of omens are stated as the discourse of Garga, which aredescribed only in the brhsamh4and the applicable chapters of the Matsyapur, 〓 andtherefore we focus on these chapters. The descriptions of these texts are so similar that the
The japaneSe asSociation ofIndian and buddhiSt Studiescomparative study of these texts is essential. consequently, the reconsideration of transi-tions of meanings of papa- and apacara- will contribute to understanding the process ofcompilation of these texts.3.The structures ofthe textsThe GSamh39contains 12 items that deals with the omens. Except the 12i item. theabove-mentioned texts, based on the discourse of garga, have parallel passages. thoughthe avparis does not have all 12items i70b and 70c, garga describes about the 12 itemsof omento atriin7ob. This shows that avparis 70b and the other texts might have includ-ed the 12items,〓. popa-
The word popa- is originally an adjective, which means bad, bringing misfortune or ef-fect of bad'.I fact, this word does not possess the concept of "fault or sin', hence thispaper will reconsider what papa- really means in those contexts.4.1.vParis
at first, the avparis does not give the causes of the omens. The papa- appears in70.Bhargaviyani, the discourse of bhrgu, as an obiect to be removed. Furthemmore, papa- indi-cates the omens, which are mentioned in the part before 70.90.1. it shows that popa- is theomens itself that bring bad effect. This could have something to do with the text's charac-ter for the priest.7)4.2.brhSamh and matsyaPurThe brhsamh says that person's conduct against human rule (apacara-) leads to the ac-cumulation of papa-, which causes of misfortune. thus the word papa- includes the con.cepts of fault or sin. The MatsyaPur also gives the similar references. These texts do notfrequently allude to pap- and apacara-. The few mentions of those two words suggest thatthere was the common knowledge about the words which probably owes to the influenceof the dharmasastra.10In the Matsyapur, the king is placed at the top of people, and on behalf of the generalpublic,11) he performs ceremonies anti) in order to control the effects caused by omensThe matsyapur says that the performing of such rituals to pacify the effects caused bymens is regarded as a part of king's duty.12) thus, the santiis related with the kingship,3
The uapaneSe asSociation ofIndian and buddhist studieS43.GSamh
The first item of the GSamh39states about the causes of the omens. however. the omenoccurs because of the king's conduct against human rule (rujapacara-). itis noteworthy tcsay, counted as a cause of omen, this is not the main cause itself. The raiopacara- is men-tioned at 39.c)as well as 39.ab, the enumerated causes are result of the conduc1against human nule ofthe people, including the king.Besides, although there are a number of occurrences of papa- in the 12h item frorr39.194to39205,1)they do not interpret it sufficiently as evil or evil deeds. In fact, theking's sins are enumerated at the end of the 12= item, after39.204. it is the king's sin thatis created for not taking action against the bad deeds. Thus, the 12=h item defines the papa-as 'bad or a bad element', and it does not attribute the connotations of fault or sin to popa-,which is the case with the brhsamh and Matsyapur. This indicates that popa- is the objectto be controlled. The connotation of the word here is thus similar to that in the avParis.speaking from the standpoint of the gsamh, it seems that the king and the priest or thefortune-teller were in the equal rank. it is noteworthy to say that the description of rajapacdra-never appears in the other texts, even in the texts like adbhutas16) and adbhutad.which directly quote the discourse of Garga.〓n the basis of this fact, we may posit that the people who are in the equal rank with theking preserve the MSS of GSamh, so that the description of the rajapacara- the king'sfault' has remained in the MSS despite the influence of other texts.5.The imterpretationThe standpoint of the texts has been delineated as above. it seems that the difference irthe social structure is connected with the establishment of the texts. Varahamihira authoredBrhsamh in the oth century. according to hazra, the applicable chapters of matsyapurwere composed in the 7th century,18) that is, the great dynasties like the gupta were ruledbefore these texts. Since the form of government in the country is shifted along with thesocial structure, it is natural to assume that the obiect of pacification changed fromthe kingto nation. That is why; the12item mentioned in the GSamhis not adopted in the avparis.Brhsamh and Matsyapur.
The japanese asSociation of Indian and buddhist Studieswe can safely say that the king and the performer are placed in the same rank in theGsamh. and this standpoint makes the impression ofan original relationship between theking and the priest. therefore, the appearance of the Gsamh might be older than the othertexts.
