The  uapaneSe sSociationofindian and buddhiStStudieSHow did the indian Masters Read the lotus sutro?MochiZuKI Kaie0. IntroductionThe lotus sutra (sddharmapundarikasutra)is one of the most popular scriptures irEast asia and many scholars have been studying on it. They discuss the complex develop-ments of its compilation or its philosophical themes like the idea of one vehicle (ekayana).but these attempts seem to be independent from the history of indian buddhism. So i willtry to put the lotus sutra into the stream of lndian buddhism again, comparing its citationsas they appearin commentaries by later indian masters.〓1.commentary on the lotus utraThere is a commentary on the lotus swtra attributed to vasubandhu. the*saddharmg-pundarikopadesa(妙法蓮華経憂婆提舎)3)in the chinese buddhist canon, but we haveno information on it in indian sources. Therefore i do not confitm its authority to vasu-bandhu in the history of indian buddhism.2.citations and references ofthe lotus sutrain Indian literature2.1.madhvamika literature2.1.1. nagariuna2.1.1.1.*mahaprainaparamitopadesa(大智度論)This cites the lotus sutra most frequently and the numbers of citations or referencescome to 23 it refers to various chapters of the sutra and considerably depends on thisscripture. but this made a strange impression on us because later commentaries never referto this text and their references are different from those of this text.2.1.1.2.*bodhisambhara(菩提資糧論)The author refers to the lotus sutra twice in this small text which exists only in the chi-
The japaneSe asSociation ofIndian and buddhiStStudiesnese translation. both references are in the context on the predictionvrakarana) of thetwo vehicles to become a buddha, therefore he could acknowledge it as one of the mainthemes of the sutra. and they come to be recognizes as the oldest references to the sutra irthe indian buddhist literature.2.1.1.2.sutrasamuccayqThough the compiler of this anthology seems to be different from the author ofthe mad-hyamakakarika, it has a great influence on later indian masters. we can see four citationsfrom the lotus sutra in it,  that is to say, in the theme on the utmost rareness of a bud-dha's apperance, twice on the utmost rareness of beings who are truly and resolutely intenton the tathagatas' completion, and on the utmost rareness of beings who are resolutely in-tent on the vehicle of oneness. especially, the last citation of this text is also referred to inlater tibetan buddhism, so this would be the first example of the reference to the theory ofone vehicle in the lotus sutra. of course we must not forget the third citation on the im-measurable lifespan of the tathagata2.1.2.bhavva: TarkaijvolaIn the fourth chapter of the tarkajvala, the commentary to his madhyamakahrdaya, theauthor cites the lotus sutra8 and jikido takasaki has already discussed this context andconcludes 1)bhavya admits the theory of the three vehicles of Yogacara as the teaching ofthe great vehicle (mahayana),2) teaches also the theory of one vehicle in the buddha na-ture, 3) depends on the literature of the yogacara, and4) cites the scripture in order toprove the theory of the one vehicle. bhavya seems to acknowledge the main theme of thesutra as the theory of the one vehicle. and the citation of the famous phrase, "there is onlyone vehicle, not two nor three(ekayana phrase)," begins here in the Madhyamika liter-2.1.3.avalokitavrata: prainapradipatikoature.
Though bhaviveka (or bhavya?) does not cite the lotus sutra in the prainapradipa,Avalokitavrata cites it in its commentary." in the commentary on the loth verse of the〓2nd chapter on the Tathagata he refutes those who do not accept his omniscience and re-fers to the sutra in order to exclude his humanity because the scripture says that he had al-ready been the buddha long ago.
The japanese association of Indian and buddhist Studies2.1.4.candrakirti2.1.4..madhyamakovatorabhosyqCandrakirti refers to the lotus sutra three times in his madhyamakovatarabhasva.0the first verse of the first chapter he cites the verse of its fourth chapter in order to explainthe meaning of the word of sravaka. in the 3oth verse of its 12th chapter he cites the eka-yana phrase of the sutra in order to prove the one vehicle theory as truth and to negate thethree vehicles theory as intended meaning and in the 38th verse he refers to the simile of avisionary castle in the sutra. candrakirti also seems to acknowledge the main theme of thesutra as the theory of the one vehicle. tThere is a sub-commentary named hadhyamakav-taratika by Jayananda and he also refers to the sutra.2..4.2.catuhsatikatikoCandrakirti refers the lotus sutra also in his catuhsatikatika again.he explains herethe wisdom of the Tathagata and says that we must acquire the supreme wisdom first be-cause an enlightened mind as its seed does not disappear not only from bodhisattva butalso sravaka and Pratyekabuddha.2.1.6. jnanagarbhaanantamukhanirhoradhoranifikoJnanagarbha who is well known as the author of the satyadvayavibhanga refers to thelotus sutra in his tantric commentary named anantamukhanirharadharamitika.)In itslast section he discusses on the prediction of sravaka and refers also to the dasadhar.〓qsutra.
2.1.7.kamalasila2.1.7.1.madhyamakulokqKamalasila discusses the one vehicle theory and criticizes the three vehicles theory ofthe Yogacara school and refers to the lotus sutra five times.14)The first two are cited inthe section of the opponent. That is to say, they consider the lotus sutra as a sutra express-ing the intended meaning on the basis of the muhoyanasutralamkara and the prediction inthe sutra as to only two special kinds of Sravaka. Then kamalasila criticizes them and citesthe ekayana phrase of the sutra in order to assert the one vehicle theory as truth. He obvi-ously acknowledges the sutra as having definitive meaning. further there is a reference tothe sutra also in his prainaparamitavairacchedikatiko .2.1.7.2.tattyasamgrahapaniikoIn the commentary to the tattvasamgraha of Santaraksita kamarasila seems to refers to
The japaneSe asSociation ofIndian and buddhiStStudiesthe lotus sutra without its title.l/ he considers the Madhyamakavadin as a wise person ofthe great vehicle and cites the passage, "only the one vehicle is the great vehicle." he ad-mits the one vehicle theory as the ultimate teaching, as seenin his madhyamakuloka.2.1.8.santideva: siksasamuccayaThis is an anthology of scriptures compiled also by Santideva and we can see four cita-tions in it.The first is cited for those whom bodhisattvas consider undesirable, the sec-ond for the possibility for all beings to be enlightened and the last two for the gift of teach-ing the dharma. Therefore he never refers to the one vehicle theory ofthe sutra in this text2.1.9.dipamkarasriinana mahosutrasamuccayaDipamkarasrjnana (atisa) also cites the lotus sutra in his anthology, the mahasutra-amuccaya.18 This citation is the same as the first reference in the siksasamuccaya, but itis longer than that of Santideva. This means that he cites these verses not from it but fromthe sutra directly though he must have read the siksasamuccaya. and he also never refersto the one vehicle theory of the sutra in his works.2.1.10.堅意:*nahayanavatarasastra(入大乘論)we can find eight references19) to the lotus sutra in the* mahayanavatarasastra. thereis no reference to the author of this workin indian buddhist literature.〓in the third refer-ence the author refers to the meditation of the lotus sutra(法華三味),a phrase whichican not findin indian buddhist literature. Further he never refers to its one vehicle theorytherefore it does not seem to have been written in india.2.2.yogacara-viinaptimatravadin literature2.2.1.maitreya: RatnagotravibhogaThere are not so many references to the lotus sutra in the Yogacara-viinaptimatravadinliteratures as in the madhyamika literatures. we can see a context of the one vehicle theoryinthe 11th chapter of the hahayanasutrolamkora of Maitreya and two further references tothe sutra in the ratnagotravibhaga attributed to him,1 which seems to be a later text. Thefirst is a reference to the simile of the visionary castle in the sutra in order to explain theidentification of buddhahood and nirvana. The second is a reference to its title and he clas-sifes beings into two. those who are entered into the nirvana and those who have enteredinto nirvana with the sutra. here he admits the three vehicles theory and considers the sutraas the teaching for the bodhisattava.
The uapaneSe asSociationofIndian and buddhiStStudies2.2.2.vasubandhu2.2.2.1. mahoyanasamgrahabhosyaIn the last chapter of the mahayanasamgraha asanga discusses the one vehicle theorywith a citation from the mahoyanasutramkarakarika.In its commentary vasubandhuconsiders the one vehicle theory as intended meaning and refers to the lotus sutra.Therefore he considers the three vehicles theory as the ultimate meaning2.2.2.2.*buddhadhatusastra(仏性論)lts authority to vasubandhu is doubted, but we can find a reference to the lotus sufra in*buddhadhotusastra. he says that the lotus sutra and so on have the true teachings but hedoes not discuss its thought.24)2.2.3.*asvabhaba mahoyanasamgrahopanibandhangAs the citation in the mahayanasamgraha,* asvabhava also refers to the lotus sutra inhis commentarylike the references of vasubandhu's commentary. he classifes the sin-gle statement of the buddha into two, namely for sravakas who have become convinced ofidentification with the buddha and for bodhisattvas who receive the same prediction.Therefore he also thinks of the three vehicles theory as truth. In the 11chapter of his com-mentary to the muhayanasutralamkora he refers to the lotus sutra.2.2.4. Sthiramatis mahoyonasutroiamkaravrttibhisvaIn the qth chapter of his commentary to the mahayanasutralamkara he refers to the lo.us sutra in order to explain the merit of the sense faculties, not the context of the onvehicle nor the prediction of sravaka. In the one vehicle context of the llth chapter he crit-icizes its one vehicle theory on the basis of the hahayanasvtralamkara. it seems to be thelotus sutra and he acknowledges it as a sutra of the intended meanings.〓82.2.5.ratnakarasanti: prainoporamitopadesgRatnakarasanti refers to the lotus sufra as the provisional meanings in his praina-paramitopadeso the one hand, he explain the one vehicle theory of the sutra in hiscommentary on the sutrasamuccaya.02.3.abhisamaya literatures2.3.1. arva-Vimuktisena bhisamayulamkarawrttiIt became popular in later indian buddhism to read the prainaparamitasutra based of aknowledge of the abhisamaydlamkarasastra by maitreya, but there seem to have been twostreams, namely, the Madhyamika reading and the Yogacara reading. Regarding the lotus
The japanese association of Indian and Buddhist Studiessutra. the former actively cites it in the context of the one vehicle theory. arya-vimuktise-na explains the various aspects ofthe nirvana on various stages and cites the lotus sutra toexplain thenirvana of Sravaka.1but he says that these nirvanas are expressions of the in-tended meaning. and there is a reference to the sutra in the abhisamtayolamkurakorikavartika of vimuktisena.2)2.3.2.haribhadrabhisamayalamkarulokqlt is well known that haribhadra criticizes the three vehicles theory of the yogacarava-din in his commentary to the abhisamayulamkara.sin this context he cites the lotusSutra to prove the one vehicle theory as the truth. Therefore he obviously acknowledgesthe three vehicles theory as the truth by Yogacara and reads the abhisamayulamkora fromthe standpoint of the madhyamaka.2.3.3.abhayakaragupta: mumimatolamkaraAbhayakaragupta also cites the same passage of the lotus sutra as haribhadra does.4He criticizes the opponents who consider the one vehicle theory as the intended meaningand says that they do not follow the ultimate one vehicle theory of the lotus sutra.2.3.4.dharmamitraabhisamayalamkaraprainaporamitopadesasostratikaprasphuta-pada
The above-mentioned commentaries refer to the lotus sutra in the context of the onevehicle theory or the prediction of sravaka, but references indharmamitra's commentarygive us a different impression. There are three citations in it.He refers to the buddha'sdharma in every aspect or teaching dharma with compassion, but not to its one vehicle the-ory.
Further there is a reference to the sutra in the bhagavatyamnyayanusarinivyakhya ofkjagaddalanivasin.363.conclusion
In the Madhyamika literature, without the siksasamuccaya, the lotus sutra is cited inthe context of the one vehicle theory or the prediction of Sravakas and these references de-velopinto the criticism of the three vehicles theory of the yogacara. in the Yogacara litera-ture the one vehicle theory in the lotus sutra is also referred to, but itis as intended mean-ing, not as the ultimate meaning. therefore they do not seem to acknowledge the lotussutra as an important scripture. in the abhisamaya literature haribhadra criticizes the three
