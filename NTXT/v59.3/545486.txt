The  uapaneSe sSociationofindian and buddhiStStudieSBhaviveka's Theory of the absolute TruthKuMagai Seiji0.IntroductionNagariuna (ca.15250),the founder of the madhyamika school,1) gave the two tnuthsthe absolute truth (paramarthasatya) and the conventional truth samvrtisatya), but hedid not subdivide them. bhaviveka (ca.50570)explained the two truths in detail bysubdividing the absolute truth. candrakirti (ca.600-650) postulated different persons suchas buddhas, saints, ordinary persons, and those with diseased eyes, and gave the two truths「or each person. Jnanagarbha (ca. 8h cen.) subdivided convention into correct conven-lion and incorrect convention.4) thus, bhaviveka is an important thinker in the history othe theory of the two truths.Recent scholars have often considered there to be only two absolute truths, that is a pri-nary one and a secondary one.〓〓 Indian madhyamika thinkers did indeed emphasize thesubdivision of the aboslute truth into two, namely that which is discursive and that whichis non-discursive. however, this subdivision alone is not enough to explain bhaviveka'stheory. The aim of this paper is to precisely examine bhaviveka's theory of the absolutetnuth and grasp the relationship with the theories of later thinkers.1.The Theory of the absolute Truth of the t/Bhaviveka gives three possible interpretations of the Sanskrit compound paramartha,namely as a[]karmadharaya, [2]tappurusa, and[bahuvrihi. taken as a bahuvrihi,he then further subdivides it into that which is non-discursive and that which isdiscursive:7,

[i] the subdivision from the point of view of non-dis-cursiveness and discursiveness was emphasized by later indian madhyamika thinkers suchas jnanagarbha, santaraksita, and bhavya who is the author of the 〓S8)[]tibetanBuddhist thinkers gave more systematic classifications by synthesizing the two subdivi-sions above, that from the point of view of the subiect and obiect and that from the point ofview ofnon-discursiveness and discursiveness.  [i]tibetan indigenous bon religion hastwo traditions: one admits the subdivision of the absolute truth and one does not admit it.The former tradition cites the passages ofthe tjconcerning the subdivision.102.The Theoryof the absolute Truth ofthe pprThe pprenumerates the following three types of absolute truth.11[1]absolute tnuth: absolute truth as object. (karmadharaya or tatpurusa)[〓]non-conceptual wisdom: absolute truth as subiect. (bahuvrihi)[〓] wisdom resulting from hearing, contemplating, and meditating: absolute truth as aneans. (There is no reference to the interpretation of the Sanskrit compound but itcorresponds to the absolute truth of bahuvrihi.)In the commentary of the ppr, that is to say the p3859:24-b7),avalokitavra-ta (ca. 700) subdivides the absolute truthintwo levels as follows:- paramorthasatyq〓paramarhasatyar absolute tmuth as object〓] paramarthasatyc absolute truthas object[Y] smketiki-paramarthasatyc[Y-1]non-conceptual wisdom: absolute truth as subject-[Y-2]wisdom resulting from hearing, contemplating, and meditating: ab--[Y-2]wisdom resulting from hearing, contemplating, and meditating: ab-solute truth as a meanstable 23.conclusionsThe tjadppr are somewhat different on the surface, but they both give three levels ofabsolute truth,[1]the absolute truth as obiect such as thusness,[2]the absolute truth as
The japaneSe asSociation ofIndian and buddhiStStudiessubject such as non-conceptual wisdom, and [3]the absolute truth as a means such as wis-dom resulting from hearing, contemplating, and meditating.Recent scholars have regarded the absolute truths as dual, one which is non-discursiveand one which is discursive. This subdivision was given by bhaviveka and it has also in-fluenced later indian madhyamika thinkers, tibetan buddhist thinkers, and even bonpothinkers. however, bhaviveka actually subdivided the absolute truth into three, so we can-not explain his understanding of the absolute truth as merely a two-fold division. his com-plex subdivision into three seems not to have been emphasized by other indian Madhyami-ka thinkers, but it was explained in detail by tibetan buddhist thinkers such as Se ra riebtsun pa.
