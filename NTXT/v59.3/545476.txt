(v.1) (〓) while the buddha makes a sojourn in the jetavana, a partyof merchants go to the seashore. (vv.2-3)(〓)seeing the merchants loading a ship, apilot wams them of the dangers of the ocean. (vv.4-7)(i) The merchants set sail for ajewel producing island; on their way back from the island, they happen to see a large fish.(vv.8-19)(v)the fish opens his mouth to swallow the merchants, at the critical momentthey utter the name of the buddha for help, the budcha hears their cry and enables the fishto hear the cry by his supernatural power, the fish gives up swallowing the merchants anddisappears into the sea. (vv.2-24)(vi)after completing a voyage, the merchantsbecome arhats. (vv.2-27)(v) The buddha tells the story about the past lives of themerchants. (vv.28)(vii) The fish starves to death and his carcass is cast away on a coastby nagas. (vv.29-31)(vi) The fish is bornin sravasti as a brahman's son nameddharmaruci ; as a youth he leaves home and becomes a monk. (vv.3-34)(〓xDharmaruci always feels hunger, a householder who comes to give alms to him is surprisedat his enormous appetite and asks the buddha who he is. (vv.35-43)(x)The buddhmakes a prophecy that dharmaruci will become an arhat and takes him to the coast wherehis carcass is left. (vv.44-48)(xi) dharmaruci feels an aversion to his own carcass, hebecomes indifferent to worldly attachment and attains arhatship. (vv.49-60)(xi) TheBuddha tells the story about the past lives of the dhamaruci: the story of the constructionof the ksemankara buddha's caitya. (vv.-74)The versions of the episode of merchants' adventures foundin Mvu, ap and the Fe biegong delucontain the following narrative elements: (iv)(Mvu245.3-,17-18,〓en bie gong de-6v(Mv09-21,Fenbie gongde lun〓b2c3),(vill)(Mvu242-24,ap022-25,en bie gong de -4).onthe other hand, the version of this episode in divy contains the following: (ii)(228.22-229.15),(〓)(22915-230.2),(〓v)(2302-231.21),(v)(23121-232.2),(vi)(232.22-233.20),(v)(233.20-234.4),(vi)(234-16),(〓x)(234.16-236.27),(x)(236.27-23918),(xi)(239.18-240.2,(xi)(2407-246.4).It is to be noted that theversion in the zeng yi ahan jing merely mentions that dharmaruci is transmigrated into afish(97a25-27).we should specifically note with regard to elementsv・dhar-av in mvu does not mention the jewel-producing island.
The japanese asSociation of Indian and buddhistStudies・dhar-av in mvu gives the leader of merchants the name sthapakarnika which is not found in theother versions. Indhar-av in mvu, furthermore. it is the elder Pumaka who hears the merchantscry.
・dhar-avinap does not mention either jewel-producing island or the buddha.dhar-av in the Fen bie gomg de lun mentions the length of the fish: about seven-thousand yoiana.The versionsin divy and av-klp do not include this descriptionThese features strongly suggest that ksemendra consulted the dhar-av preserved in thedivy while composing his own version of merchants' adventures in the av-klp.2.2. discrepancies between divy and av-klpas shown above, ksemendra's version of the episode of merchants' adventures containsanumber of narrative elements previously exhibited in the dhar-av of the divy. howeverthere are a few discrepancies between the two versions. They are as follows: (a)Iiv),Ksemendra's version gives the fish the name timimgilagila (timimgila-swallower), whilethe version of divy the name timitimimgila. (b)In(iv), ksemendra's version states thattwelve suns rise at the end of the universe, seven suns rise in the dhar-av of divy.)c)in(〓)(ix) and (xii),Ksemendra's version gives dharmaruci's father, a householder inSravasti. and a householder in ksemavati the names sumati, danavrata and dharmasilarespectively, while dhar-avindivy does not mention these names.point (a) shows that ksemendra introduces modifications to the original name so as toemphasize how big the fish is. point (b) suggests that he adopts the cosmology found inthe Puranic literature. in the matsyapurana (bombay ed.) 106.12,for example, it is saidthat the twelve suns burn the universe to nothing at its end. point (c) shows that ksemen-dra invents names for characters in the episode. clearly the names bespeak the personali-ties ofthe characters.43.dipankara buddha's prophecy3.1.list ofthe versions ofthe episode of dipankara buddha's prophecyThere are many versions of the episode of dipankara buddha's prophecy.

lt is to be noted that the karmasataka version of the episode of dipankara buddha'sprophecy is a literal tibetan translation of the divy version. accordingly the karmasatakaversion will be left out of consideration.3.2.episode structureThe episode of dipankara buddha's prophecy inav-klp has the following structure:(i)dipankara buddha appears in the city dipavati. (vv.75-77)(〓)king dipa who tulesover dipavati sends a messenger to king vasava to ask the latter to join the former in wel-coming dipankara buddha. (v.78)(〓)king vasava performs a rite with the assistanceof a brahman youth named sumati , the king offers himin retum five kinds of treasures: abed, a pitcher, a bowl, five-hundred karsopanas, and his daughter.

(vi)Sumati asks a sage to explain hisdreams, the sage suggests that he request dipankara buddha to explain the dreams, Sumatiand his friend Mati go to dipavati. (vv.91-93)(〓) sumati reaches dipavati and hearsthat dipankara buddha will enter the city; Sumati looks for flowers in order to pay homageto dipankara buddha, sumati comes across king vasava's daughter caming seven lotuses.(vv.94-99)(v) The daughter gives sumati five lotuses oncondition that sumati prom-ises to become her husband in the distant future. (vv.100-104)(〓X)dipankara buddha.

(vv.105-107)(X)Sumati and king vasava's daughter throw the lotuses towards dipankaraBuddha, sumati spreads out his hair to cover a mud puddle in order to keep the dipankaraBuddha's feet from being smeared with the mud. (vv.108-112)(XI)dipankara buddhasteps on sumati's hair and prophesies that Sumati will become the buddha named Sakya-muniin the future. (vv.113-115)(〓〓)Mati is annoyed that the dipankara buddha stepson his friend's hair and hurls abuse at dipankara buddha. (v.116)(X)Sumati andMati give up worldly life and become monks, after their death, Sumati is reborn in thetusita heaven, while Mati is reborn in hell for having hurled abuse at dipankara buddha(vv.116-118)
all the above-mentioned versions of the episode of dipankara buddha's prophecy ex.cept ap and Fen bie gong de lun, with minute differences, contain the following narrativeelements:(i),(v),(v),(X),(XI).divy version, on the other hand, contains thefollowing:(1)(24-1,(〓)(2461-),(〓)(246.16-247.14),(〓)(24-25),(v)(24725-248.4),(v)(248290),(v)(249.124917),(v)(24917-25(〓〓)(250-251.12),(x)(251.12-252.4),(〓)(252.-7,22.-253.7),(x)(252.7-8),(X)(253.-22).Noteworthy is narrative element (v).Inthe version of the episode of dipankara buddha's prophecy in divy and av-klp, it is teidreams that Sumati has (divy27.28-248.,av-klp vv.89-90), while in the version inthe guoqu i yi guo jing621b2-cl) it is five dreams that Sumati has. This factfurther suggests that ksemendra composed his version of the episode of dipankara bud-dha's prophecy on the basis of divy version.3.3.discrepancies between divy and av-klpKsemendra's version of the episode of dipankara buddha's prophecy and divy's havethe following discrepancies: (d)i〓),ksemendra gives king vasava's daughter thename sundari, which is not foundin dhar-avin divy. it is to be noted that her name is蘇羅婆提(*suravati?) in the version in the sife748c1-14).(e)〓vi),ksemendragives the sage the name parnadv.91), which is also not foundin dhar-avindivy. (f)〓nxi),Ksemendra celebrates the prophecy of dipankara buddha with a showering offlowers (puspavarsa)(v.114-15ab),while the dhar-av in divy describes thiscelebration at the arival of dipankara buddhain dipavati (257-9).what is true of point (c) in ksemendra's version of the episode of merchants' adven-
The japaneSe asSociation ofIndian and buddhiStStudiestures is tnue of points (d) and (e).it is important to note that the version in the guo qu〓ziyinguo jing (622b15-17)also celebrates the prophecy of dipankara buddha withthe flower-shower. This shows that it is likely that Ksemendra's version and this Chineseversion have a common source.4.Conclusion
we have considered the sources of the episode of merchants' adventures and that of di-pankara buddha's prophecyin dhar-av of av-klp. it has been shown that the sources of thetwo episodes which dhar-av of av-kip contains are foundin divy. Thus it follows that thesource of dhar-av of av-klpis divy. but we have to note that there is the possibility thatthe version of the episode of dipankara buddha's prophecy which ksemendra made use ofhad been altered by the influence of the source of the guoqu iziyin guo jing. in addi-tion, we must also note that the discrepancies between dhar-av i divy and av-klp showsthatin composing the two episodes ksemendra makes minor alterations in order to interes1the general reader.Notes
