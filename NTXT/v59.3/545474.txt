The  uapaneSe sSociationofindian and buddhiStStudieSThe story of the dipamkara uddha Prophecy inNorthern buddhist Texts:〓attempt at classificationMatSuMuRa Junko1.IntroductionThe story of the bodhisattva receiving the prophecy that he would become sakyamuniBuddha is narrated in both Southemn and northern buddhist literature. precisely for thereason that the story explicitly gives clear thematic emphasis to the importance of becominga buddha rather than becoming aarhant, it may be regarded as marking a turning pointfrom early buddhism to mahayana buddhism, because in Mahayana buddhism embarkingon the ages-long bodhisattva path is far more highly recommended and praised. However,the story is so popular and importantin both northern and Southern buddhism that there isa plethora of many different versions, so that, if we were to include short references andmentions of the motif, the number of related texts would be almost uncountable. althouglAkanuma, taga and lamotte made lists of appearances of the story in buddhist literature,and the former two scholars tried to classify versions ofthe story, mainly by comparing thesrder of occurrence of plot elements, their attempts do not seem very successful.1 Thepresent author has recently examined pali versions of the story, which is usually known asthe sumedhakutha in the Theravada tradition, and so has traced the relationship of theApadana versions ( the dharmarucyapadana and the yasodharopaduna) with northerrBuddhist texts.  Following up on that work, the author attempts in this article to list theNorthern versions of the story and classify them according to a plausible and rationalmethod, thereby attempting to get a bird's eye view of the different versions in both Southernand northem buddhist literature. however, because of the diversity and complexity of thestory-cycle connected to dipamkara buddha, the author confines herself to treating onlytexts containing the main plot elements of the story, i.e., dipamkara buddha's appearancein the world, the bodhisattva offering him howers, the bodhisattva spreading his hair orthe mud to stop dipamkara buddha's feet getting soiled, the bodhisattva making a vow to

types can be also verified by differences between other elements in the story, we wil1examine the first part of the story, i.e., dipamkara's birth, his enlightenment, and his visitto king's capital city where the bodhisattva is to receive the prophecy that he will becomeSakyamuni buddha. The Pali version of dipamkara buddha's birth story, narrated in bv-a78,34-83,18(eng. tr.: horner115-121),is obviously a later stereotyped fabrication imitatingGotama buddha's birth story. it will therefore not be taken into consideration. in thefollowing, a summary ofeach version will be given.12)the iuxing benqi jing修行本起經Long ago, there was a cakravartin king called dengsheng燈盛.his kingdom was called tiheyi (oTihewei)提和衞(*dipavati), and his crown prince was dengguang燈光.the king transferredthe kingdom to the crown prince on his demise, but the crown prince, having realized the impermanence (of the world), handed the kingdom over to his younger brother, renounced the worldlly life,and became dipamkara buddha(錠光佛).Having wandered through various countries in the com-pany of 20,00monks, he returned once to his homeland to save its people. however, the king ofhis homeland (i.e. dipamkara's younger brother) thought that his brother would usurp thekingdom, and so triedto prevent his visit. dipamkara buddha then, with supernatural powers, createda second capital city. Seeing that, the king was terrified and relented, and asked dipamkara buddheto visit his capital seven days later, and to accept offerings from him.(461b16-c16)In this text the bodhisattva's name is introduced as follows. "at that time there wasBrahman youth called wugouguang是時有梵志儒童,名無垢光"(461c17).howeverhe name無垢光," pure light," appears only here, and in the latter part of the story theBodhisattva is only mentioned as Rutong儒童which corresponds to Skt manava. since無垢光seems to be unusual as a word translated from Skt, we may suppose that the worcwas added by the translators, or later in the chinese textual transmission.1b) the taizi ruiying benqi jing太子瑞應本起經Long ago, when dipamkara buddha appeared in the world, the cakravartin king Zhisheng制勝("victorious") nuled over a great kingdom called bomo鉢摩(*padma).1)(472c18-19).The bodhisattva is called Rutong儒童.1c) The yichu pusa benqi jing異出菩薩本起經:In this text, although the story of dipam-kara's birth is not related, the following informationis important for comparison.The bodhisattva met dipamkara (tihanjieluo題恕竭羅)17)buddha in the capital city, bomohe鉢摩訶(*padamaka), of the king qiye耆耶(*jaya.2a) The mahavastu:dipamkara was bom in the capital city, dipavati, as the son of the cakravartin king arcimat ang

The above comparison of versions of the story of the prophecy of dipamkara buddhashows that between the three types classified according to the bodhisattva's name, thereare also clear differences in the story's plot.itype 2 versions, in which the bodhisattva'sname is Megha, the story-flow can be summarized as follows: a cakravartin king (i.e.King of jambudvipa) gives half of his kingdom to his minister and makes him a king, thelatter's son becomes dipamkara buddha, when the cakravartin king finds out about this,he requests his former minister to send dipamkara buddha to his capital, padma (ka),accompanying the request with a threat, and dipamkara buddha, out of mercy, goes to thecapital city, padma (ka).type lversions, judging from the story-flow(1a) or thecorrespondence of proper names (1b and 1c), may represent an early stage of type2versions. on the other hand, type 3 versions, in which the bodhisattva's name is Sumati,show a clear contrast with the other two types, the detailed story of dipamkara's birth isnot related. however. from the fact that in a and 3b sumati's1miraculous dreams arenarrated, and in c, ina similar manner, the bodhisattva's s dreams, we can also see closeaffinities among these three versions. Thus, the above examination has at least succeededin vindicating the classification into three recensions. in future publications, the presentauthor will further continue to examine other plot-elements of the story, and thereb)elucidate the formmation and relation of various versions of the dipamkara prophecy story.References
