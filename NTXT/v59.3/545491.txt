0.IntroductionThe MSabhahayanasutrulamkorabhasya) attributed to vasubandhu (c.4-480)is one of the most important treatises of the Yogacara tradition. Mordern scholars have es-timated that the eighteenth chapter (i.e., the bodhipaksadhikarana) of the MSabh wascomposed under the strong influence ofthe seventeenth chapter (i.e. the bodhipaksyapata-la) of the bbh(bodhisattvabhumi) of the mauli bhumi of the Ybh(yogacarabhumi)since these two texts largely share their teachings, and since, according to odani [984〓3-47], the bbh is supposed to have been composed earlier than the MSabh. the excep-tions are the theories of pudgalanairatmya and ksanabhanga, for they appear not in theBhxvII but solely in the last part of MSahxv. Hence, iwamoto[1997][200has assumed that these theories were later added to MSAhXv. She even characterizesthe theory of pudgalanairatmya in the mSabh as " abhidharmatic." concerning the rela-tionship between the akbh and the ybh, in turn, kritzer [200has revealed a resem.blance between the teachings of akh-viii and the Ybh, suggesting the possibility thatthe akbhimported many discussions from the Ybh. based on these preceding studies, thepresent paper aims at clarifying whom exactly the pudgalavacin refers to in the MSAbhadMSaXvii92-95.For this purpose, i would like to conduct a careful comparison of thethree texts. viz.. MSahXvii. akBhIX and the relevant part of the Ybh. with regardtctheir criticism of pudgulavada or atmavada.1.Structure ofthe mSabhadMSAXVII92-95According to sthiramati's commentary (SaVbh) on the MSabh, the discussion of pud-galanairatmya appearing in the MSabh ad MSaxviii92-103 is divided into two parts:the mSabhd MSaxv295is to refute a pudgulavudin, and the MSAbhad mSA
The  uapaneSe sSOciationofndian and BuddhiStStudiesxv96-103is to refute an dimavadin. The mSabhad mSAXvii9295is. Sthiramatisays, further divided into two parts: an investigation of the relation between pudgala andskandhas (the MSahxvi92-93)and its analogy with the relation between fire andfuel (the MSAbhad mSAXvi94-95).It is, however, unclear what group of thinkersthe MSAbh calls pudgalavadin. The Savbh explains it as sm bitip dag. eltchinger[2010314,cf., duelinger [2009.289]」 identifies this sm bi ti pa dag as sammitiyas.although this identification is acceptable, we should be careful about the appellationSammitiyas. There may be two possibilities: 1) itis supposed to have been used for pudgu-lavain in general, or 2)for the sammitiya school. naito [1981, for instance, hasshown that sammitiya is the generic temm for all of pudgalavadins in later writings than theMSabh and the akbh. accordingly, it may also be possible that Sthiramati calls a groupof pudgulavadins smbitipa dag in his Savbh, which is not restricted to the sommitiyaschool. apart from sthiramati's interpretation, our central question now is who exactly theMSabh refers to by "pudgalavadins"?The aforementioned theoretical resemblance between the MSabhad MSaxv92-103and akbhiXmight provide a clue for solving this question. okada and kishi [2008:61-03]have attempted to identify citations from old sutras in the msabhad mSaXvi92-.one of remarkable results is that the authors of the mSabh. the akbhas well asaccording to Miyashita[198617],the Ybh (the mauti bhumi) all quote the same passagefrom the paramarthasunyatasutra of the sasamyuktagama). This strongly suggests theclose relation among these three texts. as Murakami[199314has pointed out, there areobvious textual similarities between the mSabhad mSaXvi92-95and akbhixinthe way of refutating pudgalavada. however, for clarifying our question, i think more ac-curate examination of their contexts necessary. in the following, i would like to analyzethe context of the mSabh ad mSaXv92-95and compare it with that of akBhiXwhere the pudgalavada of vatsiputriyas is refuted as well as with that of the Ybh wherethe refutation of atmavdda apprears.2.comparative analyses2.1.fundamental positionThe fundamental position of the author of the MSabh is stated in the following discus-sion

The japanese association of Indian and buddhist studies[Pudgalavadin.] should one say that pudgala exists, [or] should one [rather] say that it does noexist? [The MSa.] answers: the pudgala must be said to exist as a [mere ] designation (prain-qppyastito), but not as a real substance (dravyatas)[MSa18.9]. and because one can sa)[with equal legitimacy] that [the pudgala] exists as a [mere] designation [nd] that it does notexist as a [real] substance. (Sahd MSAXviii9ab, cf., tr. eltschinger [2010307,6-3084])
I short, the MSabh explains the position of MSAXvi92ab that pudgala is real byway of conception, but it is not real substantially. we can see the same statement in bothAKh41,4f. and Yh16,9f. all these three texts share the view that pudgala canbe said to exist as a mere designation.2.2.relationship between pudgala and skandhasThereafter, commenting on mSaxvii93,the MSabh starts to analyze the relation-ship between pudgala and skandhas.[The pudgalavadin.] but [according to you, ] should one say that the pudgala is one [ and thesame] with or rather distinct (anya) from the [real] thing (vasiu) named ecorporeity" etc., withregard to which the [ verbal] designation " pudgala" [takes place]?[The MSa]answers: Thispudgl]be said to be neither one [and the same] with nor distinct from the [basis ofitsdesignation, ie., from the five skandhas][MSA18.9].[The pudgalavadin:]For which reason? answer:] because of the two faults [that would en-sue] [MSa18.93.[The pudgalavadin.] because of which two faults? nswer:]because [ifthe skandhas and thepudgula were one and the same,] the skandhas would be (prasanga) theself, and [if the skandhas and the pudgala were different,] the [pudgla] would be a [real]substance. [mSA18.93cd]. Forif [the skandhas and the pudg] are one [and the same], it fol-lows that the skandhas are the self, and that the pudgala is a [real] substance. but if [the skandhasand thepudgla] are distinct[, then it follows that] the pudgala exists as a [real] substance. For [itis] in this way, since the pudgala exists as a [mere] designation, [that] one is justified [in saying]that it cannot be said [to be either one and the same with or distinct from the skandhas];,[and]therefore, it is established as a point [to be left] unanswered (avyakrtavastu).(MSabh ad mSAXvii93;cf., tr. eltschinger [20311,3-312,10)In case that pudgl can be said to be real by way of conception, the question arisesDoes the pudgala is identical with or distinct from five skandhas? The MSabhad MSAXviii93states that the pudgala is neither identical nor distinct from five skandhas. lt isbecause, if the pudgala can be said to be either identical with or distinct from five skamd-has, the pudgala must be real and this would contradict the fundamental position that thepudgala can be said to be real only by way of conception. we can see the same argument
The japanese sSociation of Indian and BuddhistStudies〓khIX. which runs as follows:The pudgulavadins assert that a pudgala exists. [to determinate whether or not their assertion con-forms to the buddha's teachings,] we must first consider whether in their view a person is substan-tially real oris real by way of a conception.If the pudgala is a distinct entity like form and other such things, it is substantially real, but if [byanalysis」 it is [shown to be ] a collection [of substances], like a milk and other such things, it isreal by way ofa conception. consequently, if the pudgalais substantially real, it must be said thatitis other than the skandhas in the way each of them is other than the others, since it will possess adifferent essence [than is possessed by any of the skandhas if it is other than the skandhas, it mustbe either causally conditioned or causally unconditioned. if it is other than the skandhas and iscausally conditioned], [because we cannot understand it, the pudgalavadins] should explain itscauses. also. if he is [other than the skandhas andis] causally unconditioned, the false theory [ofatman] espoused by the tinthikas is held and the pudgla does not function [s a person. there-fore, since the pudgalavadins cannot say that pudgala is other than the skandhas, they cannot saythat it is substantially real. if it is real by way of a conception, [it is the collection of skandhas,and] this is the theory [of dtmans found in the buddha's sutras andis] held by us. [but the pudga.lavadins assert that] a person is neither substantially real nor real by way of conception. (akbhix461,1419cf., tr. duelinger [209289,10-290,2])Thus, the akbhis arguing the relationship between pudgala and skandhas in the similarmanner as the MSabh. adding to this, akbhiXcontinues to discuss the case that pudgaldis distinct from five skandhas: such a pudgala must be either conditioned or uncondi-tioned. but both possibilities are eliminated, since they are untenable and false. The pudga-lavadins or the vatsiputriyas here in the akbh also approve that pudgala can be said to beneither identical with nor distinct from five skandhas, but they also insist that pudgala isneither substantially real nor real by way of conception.with regard to the relationship between pudgala and skandhas, i would further like tocite the following refutation of atmavada from the Ybh.he (ie., the atmavadin) should explain the followings. do you assent that a designation of person(satnvaprajnapti) [refers to]1)skamdhas themselves, or2)something with skandhas, or 3) some-thing other than skandhas, or4) something not belonging to skandhas ?1)if [the designation of a person refers to] skandhas themselves, there would bean atman whichis not different from skandhas [and] substantially lasting. Therefore, this is incorrect.2)if [the designation ofa person refers to something ] with skandhas, is [such] aperson impermanent or pemanent? (…3)if [the designation of a person refers to something ] other than skandhas, due to it, a personwould be unconditioned. Therefore, this is incorrect
The uapaneSe asSociation ofIndian and buddhist studieS4)if [the designation of a person refers to something ] not belonging to skandhas, due to it, aa-〓 unconnected with a body would be without pollution at all times. Therefore, this is incorrect(Yh12.13-133.3)comparing the aforecited passages from the MSabh, the akbh and the Ybh, one couldsay that the authors shares the idea that pudgala or dtmancn be said to be neither identica.with nor distinct from five skandhos. They consider that if pudgulo or atman cn be said tobe either identical or distinct from five skandhas, it must be real. This is the traditionalBuddhist doctrine of nairatmya. considering the historical orders of these three texts, onemay assumne that this doctrine handed down from the Ybhto the mSabh and the akBh.3.fire and fuel analogyIn the mSabh ad mSaxviii95,the author criticizes the people who employ the anal-ogy of fire and fuel to explain the relationship between pudgala and skandhas. iakbIX, the author uses the same argument to refute the vatsiputriya, whereas it does not occurin the ybh. Letus first see the MSabh:If [,in the absence of any reason,] it were merely due to an example that they accepted that thepudgula cannot be said [to be either one and the same with or distinct from the skandhas, stating:]"as fire can be said to be neither distinct from nor the same as the fuel (indhana)," one should re-ply to them as follows: because of [their distinct] characteristics, because of [that which is]observed in the [ordinary] world and because ofthe [ authoritative] treatises [that speak tothe contrary], it is not correct [to affirm] that fuel and fire cannot be said [MSa18.95ac] tobe either one [and the same] or distinct [from one another]. For what we call "fire" is [nothingbut] the element fire (teiodhatu), [whereas] the fuel [consists of] the remaining [three] elements[i.e., earth, water and wind]. now since their characteristics are distinct, fire is simply other thalfuel. (MSabhad mAXv95,cf., tr. eltschinger [201031,1315,8])compare what the akbh says:ifa bumning material is both fire and fuel, fuel will be the fire. due to it, that in reliance upon whichfire is conceived will be the fire itself. Fuel is comprised of three elements [of earth, air and water]Moreover, since the skandhas themselves would also be the pudgala, it follows that they could notavoid the theory that a pudgalais not other than his skandhas. (…)Therefore, they have not shownthat a pdgala is conceived in reliance upon the skandhas in the way [n which they believe] thatfire is conceived in reliance upon fuel. (akbhX462,26-463,1,cf., tr. duelinger [2009292,18-28])
here the opponent vatsiputriya asserts that pudgala can be said to be neither one and the
The japanese AsSociation of Indian and Buddhist Studiessame with nor distinct from five skamdhas like fire and fuel, and that pudgala can be said tobe neither real substance nor real by way of conception. pointing out inconsistencies inwhat the opponent says, the author of the akbh criticizes his opponentin the same manneras the author of the MSabh does. They share the argument that ffire is the element fire andfuel is comprised of three elements (earth, air and water).4. concluding remarksBasedon the careful comparison of the three texts above, we can gain a clearer comprehension of the pudgalavadin in MSahXviii. the points of my discussion are to be sum-marized as follows:1).The mSabhad mSaxvi92-93shares the theory of nairatmyaand the refutation of pudgalavada or atmavada with the Ybh. it is presumable that theMSAbh took over the idea from the Ybh.2).The MSabhad mSaXv92-95alsoshares the way of refuting pudgala withakhix.3).In both the MSAbh and the akbh,the appellation pudgalavain refers to the opponent who demonstrates the relation betweenpudgala and skandhas by using the example of fire and fuel. therefore, i assume that thepudgalavadin in the MSabhad mSaXvi92-95can be identified with the Vatsiputriya,who is criticized as pudgalavadinikbhiX.Texts
