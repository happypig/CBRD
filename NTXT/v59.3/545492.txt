The  uapane Se sSOciationofIndian and buddhiststudies*parikoalpa usedin the mahoyanasamgrahaMatSuda kuninori1.IntroductionAsis well known, parikapa(遍計,能遍計,etc.) plays an important role in the thoughtsof the Yogacara school, as is represented by the phrases parikappita and abhutaparikapa.However, the significance of parikalpaitself, its position in the Yogacara doctrine, its rela-tion with vikolpa, and so on, do not seem to have been clarified through reviewing eachpiece of literature.In fact, parikapa means, roughly speaking, to imagine incorrectly that which does notexist as it is. This interpretation would hardly cause any problem, but it seems important toexamine it philologically and to determine its meaning in each context.In this paper, i would like to start by clarifying something about the term * parikalpaused in the mahoyanasamgraha (mS) through the descriptions of the MS and its com-mentary mahoyanasamgrahopanibandhana (mSu).2.basic characteristic of parikapawe can fnd the description of parikalpa below in the mS, where it is directly explained・MSI.16.

The japaneSe asSociation ofIndian and buddhiStStudiesAnswer:*manoviinana is *parikalpa because it is associated with*vikalpa. d] it is [of twokinds]:that which has arisen from the seeds of *vasana of own words and that which has arisenfrom the seeds of*vsand of words of all*viynaptis. Therefore, it arises from*vikalpa of infnitekinds. [That is to say], because it supposes in every respect, it is said to imagine(*pari-vkip.Therefore, it called * parikupa..The mSu comments on this passage as follows:・MSU ad MSIi.16yang kund rtogpyodcing zhes byabgspakun brigs p dpyod dot id kyirnampar shespa ni kumu rogp ste/ rnm par riogp cm gyi phyir rzhes byba ni nges par rtogp dangvjies su drpi rnam par rtog pa dang 'brelp'i phyir roff rang brjod pi bag chags kyi sa borls byung bzhes by'ba mi yid kyi rnam par shes pa yid kyi rnam pr shes pzhes thog ma medpa'i 'khor ba na tha snyad  brjiodp ste de 'i bag chags ni 'dii sa bon mo rnmpr rigthams d kyi briodpa'i bag chags kyi sa byung bhes byba mi 'di ir gzugs lss pmtha ' ys par snang bai rnmpr rigp brjiodpa't bag chags kyi ru s byung b ste der snangbar 'byung b'i ishl m'i phyir ro de 'i phyyir yid kyi rnmpr shes pa mi rnmp mtha〓p'i rmpar rgpa thams cdkis bymng h'odri26b3ff./pli277blff.[The passage] "and when*parikalpa exists, and."explains * parikalpita.* manoviinana is*parikatpa because it is associated with*vikatpa, because it is associated with * abhinirupand-vikalpa and * ausmaranavikalpa.[as for]"that which has arisen from the seeds of* vasana of own words," there are verbal ac-tivities, such as"* manoviinana""*manovijnana," in the beginningless transmigration,* visand otwhich are the seeds of this[*parikalpa/*manoviinana].[The phrase] "that which has arisen from the seeds of*visano of words of al*inaptis'[means] that which has arisen from the causes of*sand of words of *viinaptis, which appear assuch like *rupa of infinite kinds, because it has the way of arising with such appearance. Therefore,kmanoviinana arises with all*vikalpa of infinite kindsFirst, in this context, the reason that * parikalpa is regarded as* manovinana is, brietlyspeaking, being accompanied by*vikappa, and its meaning is the same as that used in theAbhidharmic context, as katano [197:p.13of., n.1] points out.Second, parikalpa is classified into two types from the viewpoint of "whichvsana ofwords has it arisen from", that is to say, that which is related to* manovinona itself andthat which is related to* viinapti.we will separately examine these two points below.
The  uapaneSe sSOciationofIndian and buddhiststudies3. being accompanied by*wikapa3.1.The case ofabhidharma literatureFirst of all, we confirm the abhidharmic understanding of two ( three) vikalpas that areconcerned with the reason that *parikalpais accompanied by*vikalpa. These are describedas follows in the akbh adakI, k.33, where the reason that the five viinanakoyas are said"not to be associated with vikalpa" is explained.・Akbh adakI.k.3ab:trividhah kila vikalpah/ svabhavabhinirupananusmaranavikapah tad esm svabhavavikalpo stinetarau tasmud avikalpaka ipyucyante/ yathaikapadako so  pudaka iti/ ema ed.35.6ff.ltis said that vikapais threefold, viz., svabhava [vikalpa], abhinirupana[ vikalpa], and anusmara-navikalpa. Then, these [five viinanakoyas] have svabhavavikalpa, but not the other two. Therefore[these」 are said "not to be associated with vikalpa" iust as a one-footed horse is said "not to be as-The meanings of these three vikalpas are as follows:sociated with a foot."・akbhad akI.k.33tatra svabhavavikalpo vitarkah s caittesu pascn nirdeksyate/ itarau punah kimsvabhavau/yathakramam

That which is not concentrated is saidto be "distracted." This is the abhinirupanavikalpa. the mental and all. [namely] concentrated andnot concentrated, smrti is the anusmaranavikatpaBecause this explanation is derived from the concern of how to put each vikalpa into theAbhidharmic system of dharmas, it is not necessarily self-evident what role each vikalpaplays. Still, at least as far as we follow this explanation, these two vikalpas are definedfrom the beginning as those that are associated with manoviinona, and for that reasonmanoviinana is said to be associated with vikaipa. Therefore, there is no problem with thefact that manovijnana is associated with vikalpa, but on the other hand, it is not obviouswhat the relation is between parikalpa and its being associated with vikalpa.4
The japaneSe asSociation ofIndian and buddhiSt Studies3.2.yogacara LiteratureNext, we examine how these three vikalpas are treated in the Yogacara literature. Thefollowing passage ofaSbh is comparatively well arranged:・ash12.(v)
sannam vinananam kati vijnanami savikalpakani kty avikaipakami/ tribhis tovad vikalpaih manouijnanam ekam savikaipakam/ trayo vikalpuh svabhavavikalpo 'nusmaranavikalpo 'bhinirupanavi-kapas c tatra svabhavavikapah prapyupamnesu smskaresv anubhuyamanesu yh svalaksanakg.ro vikalpah anusmaranavikalpo y'nubhutapurvasams karakarah/ abhinirnpanavikalpo y'titanogataprapuppamnesu viparoksesvabhyuhanakoro vikalpahff. tala ed.16.5ff.among six vinanas, how mny vinanas are associted with vikatpa and how many are not associat-ed with vikalp?First, only manovijnana is associated with vikapa with three vikalpas. vikalpais threefold, viz., svbhavavikapa, amusmaranavikappa, and abhinirupanovikapa. among them, the svabhavavikulpa isthe wikalpa that has the form of its own characteristic of present samskoras that are being experi-enced. the anusmaranavikalpa is that which have the form of previous samskaras which have beerexperienced. The abhinirupanavikalpa is that which has the form of conjecture toward previous, fu-ture, and present [samskaras] that are imperceptible...This explanation, because there is no abhidharmic restriction of the classitication ofdharmas, makes it very easy to understand that there are three vikalpcs according to theobjects or forms of vikapas. Nevertheless, its relationship with*parikalpa is not moreclear than that is in the abhidharma literature.The descriptions used in both of the texts only show that the reason, "being accompaniedby vikalpa," which is applied with three vikapas in the MSu can lead to the fact that thatwhich is accompanied by vikalpa is* manoviinana, but do not show its relationship with*parikalpa.
4.*manovivinana and*vasano of words4.1.*vosano of wordsNow, we will examine the classification of parikalpa from the viewpoint of " which*vsana of words has it arisen from?"First of all, we confirm how vusana of words(名言熏習)is treated in the MS.The MSu ad MS I.58,where three types of*vasanas are explained as a classification of*alayaviinana, reads as follows:

The following isthe passage concemed with*vasand of words.・MSI.2

The japaneSe asSociation ofIndian and buddhiSt Studiesanswer: it is*vinapti that has * alayaviinona as seed and is connoted by*abhutaparikalpa..Thus, we can find that the two descriptions given in the MSii.2and the MSi.16areparallel: in the former case,*viinapti arises from the*alayavijnana and can be thought tobe [a part of]*abhutaparikalpa, in the latter case,* manoviinana arises from the*vasandof words and can be called e parikaipa."as is mentioned above,* manoviinana is a kind of*vinapti and*vasana of words is a kind of *alayaviinana. according to this correspondence, we could say that * parikapais a kind of *abhutaparikalpain this context.5.conclusion
So far, we have outlined the descriptions on parikalpa given in the MSii.16and itscommentary mSU.The following conclusions are drawn The reason is mainly being associated with*iko-jpa that*vikolpa is considered as*manoviinana in the MSii.16, but that is based on therelationship from the first between*layavijnana and* viinaptis explained in the MSii.2.And it is thought that the mS selected*manoviinana, which can have some conceptualfunction, from1viinaptis.i would now like to go on to examine its relationship with four and five kinds of*parikapas that appear in the mSi.19,20and the position of * parikalpa used in otherYogacara literature that we could not address in this paper.1)The hahayanasamgrahabhasy (MSBh) does not directly comment on this passage.2)This sentence is a bit diffcult to understand. kaano[1975:p.129seems to conside1*manoviinana as tha smyad briod pa, but it seems that this interpretation is dubious.3)These three vikalpas also appear in the z apitamhun雜阿毘曇心論(T28.88a27ff.).api-damo piposhaun阿昆達磨大毘婆沙論(t27.219b7ff.), and so on. in those cases, theirbasic understanding is considered to be the same as that of the akBh.4)This fact may be, ina sense. a matter of course because these texts are abhidharma literatureand have different contexts, however, at least we can confirm that there seems to be no descrip-tion that makes clear the relationship between pari-vkipand vikapa.5)it might be natural to translate this as something like s… that various*vusana, viz., a particuar ability,. from which." if we supporse the original sanskrit text, but follow the tibetanword order for the present.6)the explanation appearing in the MSbhad MSI.58seems to show asimilar situation.〓)as is well known, the Tibetan translation, the chinese translation, and MSh show differenteorrespondences of 11*vinaptis to six*viinanas and so on.
