"world,' giving the meaning of the world of heaven(〓.5).it may be inferred, therefore, that svargd-, literally means 'going to the sun'slight,' is originally an adjective.〓 although a great deal of effort has been made on svargd-loka-),) the question is yet open when svargd- has come to the meaning "heaven.'The aim ofthis paper is to make clear the historical development of meaning ofthe wordsvargd-, which will offer some support for identifying the strata ofthe vedic literature1.1.The single occurrence in the Rv is the loc. sg. svarge. x95,18iti tva deva imd dhuraid yothem etid bhdvasi mrpynbamdhuh praid te devin havisa yajati svarg u tammudayase "Thus, the gods here tell you, o son of ida, how you make this possible as onebound to the death.
