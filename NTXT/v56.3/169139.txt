The  uapaneSe sSociationofindian and buddhiStStudieSwhat affected the two truths theory of jnanagarbha?:study on the satyadvayavibhanga(4)AkahaNE Ritsul1.IntroductionThe two truths theory is the primary concept of the Madhyamika school in Indian bud-dhism, in particular, and the one that jnanagarbha (ca. 700) insisted on in his text, saty-advayavibhaigavrtti (SDvv), has been studied by some researchers, including me. Somehave argued that his theory is like bhaviveka's (ca. 6c.) or candrakirti's (ca.),because of their similarities. However, itis natural that jnanagarbha, who was active afterthese two buddhists, knew their two truths theories and was infuenced by them, for inIndian tradition, the important thoughts such as the two truths theory are always handeddown from one generation to the next. Therefore, if we want to know his theory mnoreclearly, we must try to find some text or passage which played an important role when jn-anagarbha completed his theory. so in this short paper i would like to pick up one passageof the sutra, aryaksayamatinirdesasutra nS), because it is quoted as evidence of thetwo truths theory in Sdvv and other buddhists texts with comments on it. we can expec1to get an important clue about the issue at hand by comparing their understandings of it.2.Infuences from and on SDVFirst i would like to show the passage concerned as [, which is quoted in SDVv.[a] de lakun rdzob kyibden pa gang zhe na /ji snyed 'jig rten gyi tha snyad gdogs pa dang / yigedang skad dang brda bstan pa dag 〓otn dampa'i bden pani gang la sems rgyu ba yang medna/yige rnams lta smos kyang ci dgos zhes gsungssoSdvv: p.158125-29)Moreover, the following are jnanagarbha's comments on a].[Sdvv-acom] (a) 'jig rten gyi tha snyad gdags pani jig rten gyi 'jug pa ste / shes pa dang shesbya'i mtshan nyid yin gyi /rjodpar byedpa'imtshan nyid ni ma yin te / deni 'og mas brjod pa'iphyirro (b) ji snyed ces bya ba'i tshig mi mtha' dag ces bya ba'i don toc) des na rnam par

3.the Relationship between jnanagarbha and candrakirtiDid any other texts directly intluence the remains, (a) and (ci think that jnanagarbhakept a certain text in mind, at least when he wrote (a)6).what text was it? it was sun-yatasaptati-vrtti (sSv), written by candrakirti.〓the relative truth (samvrtisatya) is defined to have two characteristics, namely 〓tallworldly convention" and "all that is expressed by syllables, words, and designations." insummary, in(a) jnanagarbha explaines these two characteristics as follows,The former of the two is " the ordinary people's activity" and "all activities that are cognitive innature," but not " all activities that are verbal in nature," because it (al activities that are verbalin nature) is the character of the latteral that are expressed by syllables, words, and designations),
Here, why did he say that the former is not "all activies that are verbal in nature"? that isprobably because some person at that time insisted that the former is ""all activies that areverbal in nature"" and he wanted to cotrect that person's misunderstanding. The next ques-tion, then, is who was that person? maybe it was candrakirti. we can fnd the followingdescription in his text, SSv.[SSv] 'jig rten gyi tha snyad du gsungs pa yang gzhan gyi khong du chudpar 'dod pa'i dngos pokun nas rtogs pa'i dngos po sna tshogs pa gzhan gyi rgyud la rtog pa 'jug par byed pa la tha smyadces brioddoig rtenpa'i tha snyadmi 'jig rten th snyad de.ji ltar jig rtenpa rtogs par 'dodpa'i〓 pham tshum dh rtogs par byed p'hes par 'dod p'i d khong du chd p'd bzin

elworldly convention"" is the thing thatmakes aperson understand such a meaning as is intended[by other ordinary people ], or the thing that tell a person what he wants to know. [all worldlyonvention] has [two] characters, "all activities that are cognitive in nature"' and all activities thatare verbal in nature"."al activities that are cognitive in nature," which candrakirti shows here, is the identicalcharacter which jnanagarbha shows in (a).and "all activities that are verbal in nature"is also thought to be a character of "all worldly convention" here, which is denied inaby jnanagarbha. namely, in(a) jnanagarbha implicitly corrects this misunderstanding ofCandrakirti's about "all worldly convention," that is, one of characters of the relative truthshownin]. ifthis is true, (a) may be read as following,(i think that)"all worldly convention"" is ordinary people's actions, and (candrakirti insisted inSSv that it is "all activities that are cognitive in nature" and "all activities that are verbal innature".admit the one of the two, namely) "all activities that are cognitive in nature", but (ido) not (admiihe other, namely)"all activities that are verbalin nature".Here it is clear that jnanagarbha thought that "all worldly convention" is only "all activitiesthat are cognitive in nature"" but candrakirti thought that it is both "all activities that arecognitive in nature" and "all activities that are verbal in nature." now i think that this dif-ference between these two people's texts results from the confusion about anS's originalext, but I will try to examine this question in another peper because of limited space 〓.4.conclusion
considering the comments about 〓aquoted innST, sdvv, mav, and SSV, we canunderstand that jnanagarbha's interpretation of strongly influences santaraksita's one,on the other hand, is mostly under the influence ofanST's. itis especialily remakable that
