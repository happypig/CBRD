in the following study, i would like to examaine Tb3.8-9from two viewpoints whichserve to make clear development of the text-corpus:From comparison with thestatements of Sb13.1-5svamedha parts), especially with those of13.-3,B]fromcomparison with the actual procedure of the asvamedha, that srauta-sutrassss) of theTaittiriya school transmit in common. tablE on the following pages shows the contentsof tb38-9with remarks from those both viewponts.2.Three portions supposed to be later insertions〓.1T391考ララin the aLeThree saitri-istiss and dhrti-offeringshrtis) take place every day during theprelimitary year for asvamedha. it is striking that tb prescribes these rites "twice7. first〓b38.12lays down that each of the three sis takes place in the daytime separately, thefirst in the morning, the second in the midday and the third in the afternoon (time for thedhrtis is not mentioned). the sane procedure is prescribed also in baudhavana-srauta-sutra〓s and vadhula-srauta-sutra(ss), two old sSs of the taittiriya school. thereforeTb3.8.12would express an authentic transmission of the taittirivakas. on the other hand

The japaneSe asSociation ofIndian and buddhiSt StudiesTb has a "second prescription"" for the samerites in3.9.13.according to which the all ssshould take place only in the morning (prator) and the dhrtis in the evening ayom) asopposed to the sis. This procedure is based upon a new idea to relate the both rites withnotions of " duality"", such as " day and night" -d ratri-, ahoratro-) or "activity andest"yogaksemd-).and it does not agree with the statementin 38.12,but with sb13.4(〓1*"in the tabe) literally.a further impotant point is its unnatural text-place, which is apparently far from properplace tB3.8.1-13)for prescriptions of the preliminary rites. it follows from this thatthe text of Tb3.9.13has been composed on the basis of that in Sb134r some othertradition near sb), and that this portion is later insertion in Tb. So this might be an exampleof influence " from sb to tb", on the contrary to the general tendency pointed out by〓and.
2.2T31*〓ツinthe 〓L)Tb3.9.14, which follows the "second prescription" of sIs and dhrtis, lays down singingof two vinagathins, one of the preliminary rites for asvamedha. This portion also showsa literal correspondance with SB13.1.5*"in the tabe).not only its unnatural text-place, but it also suggests lateness of this portion that apastamba-srauta-sutra apss),which traces in general the order of Tb exactly, regards the prescription ofTb3.9.1the fee for both vinagathins) as one ofeke, "some others" (apss27.5-6).〓n the other hand, it is remarkable that the "words of song" ib agree rather withthose of bSs and vsS than those of SB. so it seems reasonable to suppose that compilerof Tb made the text of 39basing upon that of sb13.1.5(or some other canon near sb),but he revised only part containing the words of song in order to make harmony with theauthentic tradition of the taittiivakas.〓.3.8.17-1**ラinthe .Six portions of Tb(.8.13-18) lay down the night Ritual ) to be performed all night long,from evening on the first day until dawnon the second day in the main Ritual. the heartof this rite is a long series of offerings of clarified butter, honney, several kinds of grainetc. The adhvaryu priest should perform it mainly with utterance of TS(taittiriya-samhita)7.2.11-20(prescribed inb38.13-16).and besides, also many "additional offerings" with
The uapanese asSociationofIndian and buddhiStStudiesother T-mvukas. for the latter offerings, tb3.8171enumerate 35TS-4muvakusthe fotmof pratiko) to be uttered.Striking is that Sb has no text corresponding to tb3.8.17-18,and it seems suggest thatthe both portions were not introduced into tb yet, when sb borrowed the text for theasvaedha from Tb. Furthermore, in comparison with the SSs, Tb3.8.17and18 seemshow a much developed procedure: bSS(15.19-20[24,9-22,4]), for example, prescribes18tS-mvakas for the additional offerings, and vSS(11.5.1.18-254; ed. chaubEY:11.13.16-21) enumerates only 9.though apsS(2010.8-2012) shows-amuvakasfor these offerings (almost identical withuvukas in tb), but this procedure is regardedas one of eke. now it would be reasonable understanding that the text of Tb3.8.17-18has been made much later than other portions of TB3.8-9,and, even in the period ofcompilation of apsS, it was not belonging to the authentic tradition of the taittiriyakasBesides, the list of formulae in B3.8.17-18contain many TS-anuvakas to be usedoriginally in the main ritual as well as in the preliminary ritual, while bss and vssenumerate only formulae teken from the anuvakas for the preliminary ritual of theasvamedha. and it would represent a development of ritualistic thought: the both SSsprescribe "to reuse" the formulae already used until the first day of main ritual, but Tbwants to collect"" the formulae for the night ritual from all parts of the asvamedhayet.
3.younger layerof the Text-corpus ofTB3.89.13-23)a further important remark is that a glance at the tae reveals that the part of TE3.9.13-23(bold-faced) contains various sorts of brahmana: TB3.9.1314,17,21,22haveprescniptions for the preliminary ritual; 3.9.15,16,20for the Main ritual, 3.9.18 forriteafter conclusion of the main Ritual; and 3.8.19,23(partially2and22also) show mysticintetpretations of the asvamedha. This confusion of contents makes an impression thatthe part 3.9.13-23might be youger than the preceeding part(3.8.1-9.12)which reflectsgenerally the order of the actual procedure of the asvamnedha.turning to the relation between tb and sb, we find a clear tendency for the parallelismto disappear: four portions of sb(with preceding asterisk [*]in the table) show muchdifferent opinions from those of tb, and Sb has no text conresponding to tb3.9.22and23.it would suggest that, in the period oftext-borrowing by sb fromtb, the part of Tb
The uapaneSe asSociation ofIndian and buddhist studieS3.9.13-23was not established in the present form vet.However, i would like to emphasize that Tb3.9.13-23contains also some portions whichseem to be putin reasonable text-place, according with the actual procedure: tb3.9.15foofferings in the avabhrtha, 3.9.16(partial) for rites following the avabhrtha, and3.9.18for twelve brahmmaudana ceremonies to be executed after conclusion of the main Ritual.And at least 3.9.15and18 likewise 3.9.19have evident parallels in the final part of Sb13.3(remarked by italic numbers in the tabE).supposedly, the part tb3.9.13-23tepresentsgenerally a younger layerint3-9,but some portions, for example 3.9.15,18(maybe19also), couldbe as old as those in the preceeding part(3.8.1-3.9.12).and these potions mighthave been the "core"", around which one added the younger elements in later period.1)w. caland 〓note on the satapathabrahmana"ia orientalia vol.10(1932),pp.126-134
