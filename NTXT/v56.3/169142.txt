The japanese sSOciationof Indian and buddhistStudies〓n*nimitta and*drstiin the mahoyanasamgrahaMAaTSuda kuninori1.introductionIn the early yogacara school, the term "nimittd" plays a very important role in discus-sions of ontology and epistemology. while this term is used in various contexts, one of themost important examples is that in the mahayanasamgraha mS), where* nimitta is usedin contrast to* drsti. needless to say, this usage of *nimitta and *drsti is considered a pre-ursor of the theory of consciousness composed of four parts in the subsequent Faxiang法相school.
Now, in the mS, chap. ii, eleven representations(vijnapti) are enumerated as character-istics of *paratantra that which depends on others")), and later in the same work the theoryof representation-only(*vinaptimatrata ) is established. in the course of its establishment,it is explained that representations are accompanied by two portions, namely, *nimitta and*drsti.
Inconnection with this passage, nagao [1982:p.314]gives an explanation to the effectthat every one of these eleven representations is divided into the two portions* nimitta and* drsti. here the two portions * nimitta and *rsti seem to be, so to speak, subdivisions ofthe representation. but can the relationship between these two and the representation reallybe like this?In this paper i would like to reconsider the relationship between the representation-only)and the pair *nimitta and*drsti by reexamining the descriptions given in the mS and itscommentary, the mahoyanasamgrahabhasymSbh).2.mS〓.11
First, we shall examine the description given in the mSIi.11.question: how is it established that these representations(*inapti) are representation-only(*-
The japaneSe asSociation ofIndian and buddhiSt Studiesnuaptimatra)?answer: itis established in brief from three aspects:(1)from [the aspect] that they are that-onlybecause they have no objects,(2) from [the aspect ] of twofoldness because the representation isaccomnpanied by the *nimitta and the* drsti;, (3) from [the aspect] that various things arise at thesame time because [ representations] arise with various shapes.In this way, (1)these representations are that-only (representation-only) because of having noobjects; and (2)[the fepresentation] is accompanied by the* nimitta and the*trsti because, withregard to representations of eye, etc., form, etc., turn into the * nimitta and consciousness of tha:(eye) thtough to consciousness of body turn into the*irsti, and because the mind-representationis accompanied by the*nimitta with reference to all representations from eve through to* harmoand is accompanied by the*drsti with teference to the representation of mind-consciousness. forhe mind-consciousness is the inagination(*vikaipa) and is produced by all things which appearas tepresentations. There is a stanza regarding this:Yogins hope to understand that-only, twofoldness, and manifoldness. if one who has entered intohemind-only leaves that, then also [one leaves the mind-only].This is a passage which discusses three aspects concerning so-called representation-only(〓viinaptimatra), and the*nimitta and the*drsti are treated as portions (cha cig) of repre.sentation-only.Moreover, s these representations"" as used here refers to the eleven representations ofthe body and so on that are explained in the mSii.2. which are characteristics(*aksana)of the * paratantra. inconcrete terms, the eighteen*dhutus are thought to be meant here.Here, as mentioned above, nagao [1982:p.314]gives an explanation to the follow-ing effect: every one of these eleven representations is accompanied by the two portions*nimitta and *drsti up to ii.12, and then it is comprehensively explained in i13 that therepresentation of alayaviinana has the two portions*mimitta and *drsti.However, this intetpretation seems somnewhat dubious. The mSii.11mentioned aboveexplains only the mutual relationship among the eleven representations appearing as eigh-teen*dhatus, shown in table 1,but does not state that each of the eleven representations issubdivided into two portions.In other words, only when the eye and so on appear as an object of the mind can theyturn into the*nimitta, but it is not the case that they are the* drsti. likewise, eye-con-sciousness and so on tun into the*drsti only when they grasp their objects, but they arenot said to be the*mimitta in that case.

In this manner, the * nimitta and the* drsti only indicate a mutual relationship among re.presentations.3.Sbhad MSI.11Next. we shall examine the MSbhon this point. The mSbh states with regardto (2)(and(3))as follows:〓nd the twofoldness will be established through the consciousness(vinana) accompanied bythe* nimitta and the consciousness accompanied by the*drsti. ifa portion cha gcig) of the singlerepresentation-only turns into the * nimitta and another pottion turns into the" trsti, then again theevye-consciousness and so on are twofold and are established to be of various natures, even so, inhat single representation-only, some portion arises suitably as various things and is grasped by an-other in that way. moreover, because they are grasped by mind-consciousness, the representationsof that which begins with eve and ends with*aharma turn into the *nimitta, therefore, the mind-consciousness is said to be the*drsti in this way. it is also shown that they (representations) arethe cause of the mind-consciousness because [ the mind-conscioustess] does not make individualdecisions. and because other [consciousnesses] make individual decisions about their objects, theyhave no imagination(*vikatpa). therefore, that which is accompanied by the imagination is callecthe*drsti. in this way, itis established that this is representation-only.(MSbh ad mSi.11,d1l-b1)It is considered that this description in the mSbh ad mSii.11states what we have ar.gued with regard to the mS i.11ina simpler way.That is to say, as for the single representation-only, some portion ., representation)turns into the * nimita and another turns into the * drsti,1) ad consequently the grasping ofobiects is established.Therefore "some portion" as used here means a representation as a member of represen-tations in the sense that some member of the representation-only, i.e., representations notaccompanied by external objects, turns into the* mimitta and another turns into the* drstiaccording to the circumstances, but there is no need to assume that each of the representa-tions is subdivided into the * nimitta and the* drsti.

Finally, we shall examine in brief the*nimitta and the* drsti with respect to dlayavi-inung .
and in some cases the representation of ulayapiinoma is established as object representation. insuch cases too it should be understood that all other representations apart fromit (dlayavijnana)turn into the representation as the * imitta for it, and that the representation of the mind-conscious-ness with its support turns into the*drsti for it. because the tepresentations that turn into the*nimi-ta are the*nimitta (causes) of the arising of the* drstis, they(*nimitta representations) functioias a basis of their arising when [representations] appear as the obiects are.In this wav, it is established that these representations are the representation-only.here the phrase the representation of ulayaviinuna is established as object representa-tion"" may probably be considered to indicate, as nagao [1982:p.314,notel] shows, thesame situation as described in the mudhpantavibhaga i, k.3,namely, that dlayaviinana ap-pears as obiects.ln this case too*nimitta means the representations and *drsti means the representation)f mind-consciousness (and its support), and at the same time it is clear that both are estab-lished through their mutual relationship.〓5.conclusion
In the above we have examined the relationship between the two porttions, namely, the*nimitta and the* drsti, and representation-only)in the mS and mSbh. as a result, wemay draw the following conclusions.In these passages, the portions*nimitta and* drsti basically refer to the representationsthat have a relationship between that which is to be grasped and that which grasps, andthey are established through the relationship among representations consisting of sense or-gans, consciousnesses, and objects.Furthermore, " pottion"" as used here does notmea a subdivision of each representation,but a member, which is a representation, ofthe representation-only, that is, eleven or someother number of representations not accompanied by external objects, and it is shown thatsome member, i.e., representation, turns into the * nimitta and another tumns into the * drstiaccording to the circumstances.

1)however there is a difference in that the mSbh emphasizes the mind-consciousness as the*drsti on the basis of the view that that which is accompanied by the imagination is the * drsti2)In this connection it may be noted that asvabhava explains in the mahayunasamgraho-panibandhana (23b2)that "being accompanied by the two"" means "coexisting with the two"(de gmyis dang lham cigpa). this statement may also suggest that the* nimitta and the *drsti arenot subdivisions of the representations, but are dealt with on the same level as the representa-tions.
3)as the phrase "in some cases.. " shows, this passage does not necessarily concern the maintopic. it only shows that the * mimitta and the* drsti can also be established with respect to dlaya-virnana.
