The uapanese asSociationofIndian and buddhiStStudiesThe battle between viiayabahu i and the damilas:credibility of the information on the battle in the culavamsYabuuchi Satoko1.introductionIn the late anuradhapura period, in the invasions from south india to sri lanka, theSmhala king mahinda v82-1029)was finally made a prisoner of war of the colas, andthe sri lankan capital of anuradhapura was occupied. The political situation led to utterchaos, and buddhist monasteries were plundered after northetn sri lanka came under therule of the colas. later, the sihala king viiayabahui(15-1110) drove out the cola army,acceded to the throne in polonnaruva, and reestablished Sihala control of the island. ac-cording to the culavas, vilayabahui exterminated the damilas root and branchinhis battle.1) however, various epigraphical records have confirmed that they stayed on theisland.
In this article, the credibility of the information provided in the cv. on the extermina-tion of the damilas is considered by examining the influx of the damilas into the island,using chiefly epigraphical records before and after the battle between vijayabahu l and thedamilas. examples from other parts of the cv. of the protection of brahmans by the courtof sri lanka are also taken into account.2.The accounts in the cv. regarding the invasionof the colasaccounts dealing with the invasions from South india have been passed down from theearly days. according to the cv., pandu invaded sri lanka in the reign of sena i(3-853),2〓 an invasion which was avenged by an expedition to pandu during the reignof Sena〓(853-887).3)Further, the colas invaded the island during the reigns of both udaya iv (946954)4)and Mahinda v(982-1029),5)and took Mahinda v captive.)Since mahinda v wandered from the path of statecraft and was of vety weak character,the peasants did not deliver shares of their produce to him. because he lost his fortune

The situation that prevailed in the remaining parts of thecountry-kerala, sihalas, and kannatas, wherein the governments ruled as they pleased-was observed by a horse-dealer from india. on his return, he informed the cola king ofthe conditions in lanka. Thereafter, the cola army, a strong body oftroops, arrived on theisland,8 first establishing its rule inrajarattha, the northern part of the island, setting upits base in polonnaruva,9 and then advancing further to rohana.1)According to the cv., the cola army ravaged the buddhist Sangha on the island. it de-stroyed the ratanavaluka-thupa, jetavana-thupa, abhayagiri-thupa, and Maricavatti-thupa〓n anuradhapura.11in addition, it demolished the relic chambers and two Thuparamas inMahagama,a) and the cetiya of the baddhaguna-vihara in rohana.13) Furthermore, thearmy carried away many valuable images of gold, etc., violently destroying all the monas-teries. Like blood-sucking yakkhas, according to the cv., the cola army took all the treasures of lanka.14)In the thirty-sixth year of the reign of mahinda v, the cola army took him and his queenllong with the treasures he had inherited as symbols of his kingship,1)to cola, wherele died after twelve years.1after his son, the sihala king vikkamabahu(29-1040),tied from the wind disease at the time of the outbreak of the war against the damilas,,the kings frompandu and oudh, vikkamapandu(2-1043), jagatipala(3-1046), andParakkamapandu -1048), took advantage of the situation and ruled the rohana dis-rictin si lanka.18 however, these foreign kings were not able to control the sri lankanpeople, and the situation in sri Lanka became more chaotic. This further consolidated therule of the colas, who advanced to Rohana. The cv. says that kitti, a son of Moggallanaand a descendent of king manavamma,9) and lokita, who belonged to the royal lineageof king dathopatissa, 0) drove out the colas from rohana1and exterminated the damias,a gaining the victoty at anuradhapura.23) thereafter, kitti acceded to the throneipolonnaruva as viiayabahul.24.3.archaeological evidence concerning the existence of the damilas on the islandThere is no concrete evidence that the damilas settled down on the island on a large

This assumption is based on the fact that there was a referenceto velakka in the pillar-inscription which was brought to the colombo Museum and whichdates back to the reign of kassapa iv(898-914)in the late anuradhapura period.3) inad-dition, the fact that some damilas, not only mercenaries but also government officials whohad served the colas, were employed by vijayabahu i after his conquest of the colas, canbe confirmed by the copper-plate charter from his reign, an epigraphical record discov-red in panakaduva.34) moreover, there is a reference to a structure known as demala-pahiin dimbulagala, a structure which is presumed to have been built during his reign. itsname is engraved on the rock-inscription on the mara-vidiye,35) suggesting that there werDamila buddhists at that time. according to the pillar-inscriptions at budumuttava, in hisreign, a group of damila blacksmiths lived in the kurunagala area.30 The slab-inscriptionat Palamottai dating from his reign mentions the presence of seven damila women in theHindu shrine of siva.37)The fact that the images of gods such as siva, parvati, karttikeya, ganesa, kali, andLaksmi8) and shrines of the South indian style9) dating back to the polonnaruva period,were found in the capital city of polonnaruva reveals that the beliefs and rituals of hindu-

ism had spread significantly by that time and that damila artisans used to visit the islandthen.4 therefore, it appears that the damilas" settlement increased even after the expul-sion of the colas, and that many mercenaries, craftsmen, brahmans, etc., migrated to theisland from various parts of south india.4.The protectionprovided bythe sihala kings to the brahmans onthe islandaccounts in the mahovamshv.) dating back to the anuradhapura period say thatthe sihala royal families had lent support to the brahmans, in spite of buddhism being thenational religion in sri lanka. this custom did not changein the polonnaruva period. evenviayabahu i, who recaptured power from the colas and was then enthroned at polonnaru-va, did not support the persecution of hinduism. he did not remove anything that had beencontributed to the various shrines till that time.41)it appears that a large number of brah-mans visited sri lanka during the course of the rule of the colas, and it is presumed thatthey were permanent residents of at least kantalay or the surrounding villages under theeign of viiayabahu i. according to the tamil slab-inscriptions discovered at palamottaiwhich date back to the forty-second year of vijayabahu i's reign, there was a shrine ofsiva that was named after vijayaraia-isvaram, as he had supported it.Further, the placewhere the brahmans had settled was known as vijayaraja-caturvedi-mangalam,43) andKantalay, located in the Trincomalee district in the northeast parts of si lanka, becamethe village where they lived.44,brahmans were also employed in the court during the polonnaruva period, and they per-formed the rites of passage for the sihala kings. according to the cv., when manabharanaasked apurohita the meaning of his dream, the purohita predicted the birth of a prince withmarks of good fortune.4 such a son was bomn to manabharana and later grew up to beKing parakamabahui(1153-1186),the greatest hero in Sri lanka, who unified all the polit-ical powers as well as the buddhist nikoyas of the Sangha on the island. For him, manabh-arana arranged and brahmans conducted birth rites and other rituals4 such as the ear-piercing ceremony kannavedhamaha) and the ceremony of marking the prince's eating ofhis first rice (annapasanamangala)4after the death of manabharana, his younger brother,sirivallabha, raised Parakkambahu and arranged for brahmans to perform parakkambahu'sfirst dressing of the hair ceremony (sikhamaha).48 later, Parakkamabahu lived with an-other of manabharana's younger brothers, kittisirimegha, in dakkhinadesa, who ordered

Thus, although the sihalas fought fierce battles with the dami-las, it is affirmed that the Smhala kings were tolerant toward their religion.5.conclusion
as considered above, it is confirmed that from the late anuradhapura period, damilassettled on the island, and even after the victory of viiayabahu i against the colas, theycontinued to live on the island during the Polonnaruva period. Therefore, it is clear thatviiayabahu i's battles against the colas were not fought with them because they were ofthe damila race. thus, the statement in the fock-inscription discoveredinmbagamuva inhe reign of viiayabahu i, "he drove away wholly the darkness of tamil forces,"5)i.e., hdrove away the darkness of the tamil (cola) military, aptly describes this case.attention should be paid to the possibility that the expressions of predominance of theSmhalas over the damilas have been exaggerated by the compilers of the cv., these exag-gerated expressions imply that the kings of Sri lanka should be seen as heroes who gainedabsolute victories against the enemies who threatened the stability of political situationsand against the well-being of buddhism.(abbreviations and texts)しv.culavamsa, pTS/hv. hahavamsa, pTsz.epigraphieylanica<notes )
