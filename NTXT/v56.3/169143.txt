[〓1introductionas is well known, a viruddhavyabhicarin or antinomy can be caused by two inferenceseach of which satisfies the three conditions of logical reason linga, hetu). the followinginferences a and b which are given by dignaga give rise to an antinomy, while each in-ference by itself is valid bv the criteria of the three conditions stipulated in his pramanc-somwiccvo.
(a) sound (sabdu) is non-eternal (anipya),because of being produced (krtakatvat), like apot (ghata)(b)sound is eternal (nipya ),because of being audible (sravanatvat), like sound-ness sabdatva ).roroua wvpo puscorns sormuleuniecrsobsno dcma bronedums dbeingadiblnos mdleBecause both inferences a and b are valid according to the three conditions (. hetu existsin the paksa, 2. hetu exists in only sapaksa, 3. hetu does not exist in vipaksa), it is impossible todetermine whether a soundis non-eternal or eternal1. here, however, the example (drstanta)"sound-ness"" in the inference b is not accepted by buddhists but by nyaya-vaisesikaschools (cf. kitagawa, p.194).dignaga states as follows:fFor one who accepts eternal universals, both being-produced-ness and being-audible-ness makeinconclusive reasons about whether a sound is eternal or non-eternal.Then, is it necessary that although the inference a is considered valid by both buddhistsand theit opponents, the validity of the inference b,namely the antinomy, is approvedonly by those who accept the " eternal universals"9i fact, kitagawa (p.36,fn.49)saysthat the antinomy "can arise only when there is something wrong in the outlook on theuniverse," and conchudes that the metaphysical standpoint-there exists a universal, and itis perceived by a sense organ-, which is supposedly required to establish the eternality ofsound, is wrong.
The  uapanese sSociationofIndian and buddhistStudiesHowever, we can make a mathematical example of viruddhavyabhicarin.this fact leadsus to the conclusion that the phenomenon of viruddhavyabhicarin has its logical root inthe dignaga's logic of the three conditions of hetu).the present paper shows a necessarycondition of viruddharpabhicurin and presents a minimal model of viruddhapyabhicorin.The model will gives us a clear view of the logical structure of viruddhavyabhicorin.[1]anecessary condition of virnddhavyabhicoriLet us suppose that the following pair of two valid inferences results in a wiruddhavyabhicdrin.
(a1)there exists sinp, because of h.(a2)there exists Tip, because of gHere the properties h and g satisfy the three conditions of hetu in the inference al anda2respectively, and the properties S and Tare incompatible (virodha), that is to say, S andTcannot exist in pat the same time. then we can prove that the paksa pis the only locusdharmin) that has bothh and G. before going into the proof, some remarks are to be made.I dignaga'spramanasamuccaya whether the basis of inference is the second conditionof hetu, the third condition, or the hetu-sadhya relationship (yatrg .. tatra... ) is not so clear.J.F.Staal(took the hetu-suchya relationship. which he terms vyapti. as the ba-sis of inference and fomalized itash,x〓,x)), which reads: for any locus xifhexists in x then s exists in x. although staal dealt with dharmakirti's logic, we can safelyapply his formalizations in essence to dignaga's logic. in the following, i use the chinese-Japanese buddhist traditional term eexample-body(喩体)"instead of " pyapt sice digna-ga's meaning of"pyapfi" is, it seems to me, ambiguous.staal proved successfully that the third condition of hetu logically implies the example-body oyatra .. tatra .. ), but failed in the proof of the implication of the example-body by thesecond condition of hetu. the present paper will show the inplication later. for the pres-ent, we also take the example-body as the basis of inference〓 , and try to obtain anecessarcondition of viruddhoavyabhicarin.anecessary condition of viruddhavyabhicarin is that the paksa pis the only locus (dharmin)that has bothhand g. tThe proof is as followsSince s and t are incompatible. formulas(1)〓,x(t, x))and

The formula () reads: for any locus xifxhas the property h then the locus x has the prop-erty S on the condition that the locus x is not the paksa. Read the formula(4)in the samemanner.

3]deductionofexample-body from the second conditionof hetuIn the previous section, we constructed a minimal model of viruddhovyubhicarin on thebasis of the necessary condition of viruddhavyabhicarin) derived from the example-bodies inthe inferences. however, the phenomenon of viruddhovyabhicorin arises from the pairo1inferences each of which is valid according to the three conditions of hetu. therefore, itisrequired to derive logically the example-body from the second and third conditions of hetu.The formal deduction ofexample-body (vyopti) from the third condition of hetu was essen-tially made by J.F.staal (198p.93-108, especially pp.93-97).only a slight modifica-tion of staal's formalization suffices to derive the dignaga's example-body from the thirdcondition of hetu. so. we leave it aside now.The second condition of hetu sapaksa eva sattuam [hetu] exists only in sapaksa ) was formal-izedby staalas yypaksa).andhe made use of arestricted-variable to de-note sapaksa, with the result of the following formalization ofthe second condition of hetu(staal,1988,p.94〓)a(s, x))
(In general, the restricted-variable a xflx) is made use of to denote any of the values of x such thatf(x). staal used the restricted-variable to handle sapaksa as a term in a proposition.) he intended todeduce the formula of the example-bodyvyopti)-y)h,y,y))-from the aboveformula. but his proof was defective (cf. staal, 1988, introduction, p.23, ueda200,pp.98-99).Now, we present a formal deduction of the example-body from the second condition ofhefu. in the following, the next symbols are used.aS-, x～a(S, x), (S-denotes the absence ofthe property s)

「4]concluding remarkswe have obtained a necessary condition of viruddhavyabhicarin on the basis of the exam-ple-body (vyopti), and made a minimal model of wiruddhayabhicarin using the condition.And we have shown that the second condition of hetu logically implies the example-body(the imnplication by the third condition of hetu was already shownby staal), therefore we can safelyay that the above necessary condition applies to the dignaga's logic of the three condi-tions of hetu. in connection with our argument, note that we do not need the concept ofclass or set to interpret the second (and third) condition of hetu.bibliography.knakavarman's version of psv. vamanasamuccay-vrtti
