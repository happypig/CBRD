The  uapaneSe sSociationofindian and buddhiStStudies"two Truths"" (satyadvoya) in the dbu ma bden gmyis(sapyadayavibhaniga) of the bon ReligionKuMagai Seiji1.introductionThe idea of "two truths" (satyaduaya, bden gmpyis), which is emphasized in buddhism, alsoexists in the bon religion. in this article, as a part of the study of the idea of "two truths"of the bon religion, i take up the dbu ma bden gmris kyi gzhung (bobd) written by Yar meShes rab 'od zer1058-1132).there is its commentary by a bon authority, mnyam medShes rab rgyal mtshan1415)anditis quoted in the 〓osgs byedGb)by trestonrgyal mtshan dpal14.accordingly we can understand that the bodis an impor-tant treatise in the bon religion concerning the idea of "etwo truths". ioutline the idea of "twotruths" in the bobdas follows:2."two truths" (sapyadyaya, bden gnyris)On the " two truths", the bobdprovides the following explanation:Two truths which eliminate the disease of adherence to the existence""〓al manifest "principles" (harma) exist as two truthsこ3.the subject of understanding the appearanceThete are four subiects of understanding the appearance, and they are as follows:(1)"sufferer ofeye disease" (mig skyoncn) sees everything as double.4)(2)" ordinary person"so'i skyye bo) sees various things and becomes attached to them.(3)"wisdom attained later" (ries shes) understands that the appearance is like an illusion andfalse.6)

[The impureconvention:] they consider all "principles"" of the "wheel of life"" samsara), namely variousobjects and subjects of cognition, as "truth"spya) according to its appearance, and [itsessence ] is covered. [The pure convention: wisdom attained later] understands that the ap-pearance is like a dream and an illusion, and objects are not covered [by imagination].asfar as the " impure convention", there are two types. namely they are the " false [conven-tionand the "true [convention.The " false conventio"]a sufferer of an eye disease,who sees everything as double, has falsehood in both his sensory organ and the objects heperceives. [whenhe is] compared to someone who does not possess falsehood, [his objectsare ] designated as the "false [convention".the " true convention" is what those who donothave defiled sensory organs, namely the people of the world grasp."1The classificationof econvention"" is as follows:econvention""ku rhob)〓pure convention" (ag pa kun rob)〓pure convention""gpa kurdzob)-impure convention" m dg kun rdob)*true convention" (yamg dg ku rdo"false conventio" p kun ruhob)-"false convention"" gpa kun rdoThe correspondence between the conventions and the subjects of understanding appear-ance is as follows.(1)"sufferer of eye disease" "false convention"(2)"ordinary person" "real convention"(3)"wisdom attained later" "pure convention"(4)" imeditative equilibriumm of budh"no correspondence5.absolute""(paramartha, don dm)according to the bobd, "the definition of the "absolute" is to be severed [and do noexist], but [as a linguistic expression it is explained as] being divorced from discursive

with regard to its etymology, the bobdexplains that " [the "absolute"" is] a obiect andmn excellent one at that, or an object of excellent [wisdom]2).bbd adopts the two in-terpretations, karmadhuraya and tuppurusq, but not the interpretation of bahuvrihi which isadopted as the third intetpretation by bhaviveka.on the classification of the "absolute", bobdexplains that the " absolute"" is separatedfrom discursive ideas and is not established as [an obiectl. itsl number and classificationare severed [and do not exist]. The teacher preached [the " absolute"]by [referring to itsnumbers and similar examples and characterizing terms according to [the levels ofl his dis-ciples" thought".13 The bobd does not allow for the classification of the "absolute"", fasitrecognizes ] only a single  absolute".6. conclusionIn this article, ioutlined the structure of "two truths" of bod,as a partof study of * twotruths" of the bon religion. in other texts (e.g.bgsb), a different structure of "two truths"exists. it is my hope that the structures of " two truths" seen in those texts are clarified infuture research.Generally we accept that the bon religion adopted a lot from the structure of ideas foundin buddhism and built its own structure of ideas. Then which idea of "two truths"ibud-dhism did they adopt? in order to solve this problem, we need to compare the ideas of etwotruths" of buddhism and those of the bonreligionin detail.〓abbreviationbGb〓o gl byedof tre stonrgyalmtshan dpal, ed. mimaki and Samten7).〓bddbu ma bden gyis fyi gzhtng of yar me (me ston) shes rab odzer, sa m rmam'byedphrul sgron rsa 'grel theg chen gzhi lm brcsbu rsa grel dbu ma rtsa grel skor gyigsungs pod bzhungs, vol. 2(Kha), kathumandu,1991, text no. cha0p.)dbu mgbden gmyis kyi gzhung edited by Yam lama and samtin jansin read Sangye tenzin andsamten Gyaltsen), delhi,1961)〓bdgtheg pachenpo dbu ma bden gyris kyi grelba ofmnyam med shes tab rgyal mtshan, s〓m rnam byed phrmj sgron rsa grel theg chen gzhi lcm bras bn rfya 'grel dbu ma rtsggrel skor gyigsungs pod bzhungs, vol. 2(Kha), kathumandu,1991, text no. ja(45p..
