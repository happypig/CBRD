The uapanese asSociation of Indian and buddhist Studiesbackground to the compilation of chapter ivofthe aiatasatrukaukrtyavinodhanasutra (t. miyazaki)(75we will now survey the contents of chs. iii and v i order to verify that they haveno connection with ch. 〓v. The previous chapter, ch. iii, tells of manjusri surpassingsamadhi and his and sakyamumi's previous life. while ch. iv adjusts the main focus tothe argument of the advantage of Mahayana over the sravakayana, ch.iii places it on theemphasis of the absolute superiority of Maniusri. itis in ch. v) that the main story oftheakvbegins, with the appearance of king ajatasatru, whose name composes the title ofthis sutra and who is one of the main characters. king aiatasatru immplores the buddha torelieve him of his remorse(*kaukytya) for killing his father. but in ch. v, his remorse isnot in fact relieved by the buddha and maniusti, and the stoty continues over successivechapters. So, the chapters before ch. v can be regarded as a prologue to the main storwhich begins fromch. v.Judging from the above, the content of ch. ivof the a4jkvseems to stand alone and bevirtually independent ofthe previous and subsequent chapters.3.differences and inconsistencies in the characters of ch. 〓VThe main story in ch. ivof the ajkv, dealing with the previous life of sakyamuni and histwo great sravakas, develops through the dialogue between sakyamuni and sariputra aswe saw above, and manjusri, who plays important roles in other parts of the ajikv, neverappears. it is in this point that ch. iv differs from the other chapters of the aikv.letus move onto the inconsistency of the characters. inch. iv, * Sagaramati appears asamonk of the past who waits on the past buddha * sarvabhibhavana .o the other hand,〓 ch. iof the 4v,*sagaramati appears as one of the2bodhisattvas who discusshow*sarvaina is acquired.these two characters are obviously not the same person, butboth take the same name in the one book. we may assume that this inconsistency of thecharacters between chs.ivand iis caused by discontinuity between the chapters.1.

Then, how were the preceding chapters, chs I and ii composedFirst of all, the maincharactors in chs. I and ii, bodhisttva* pratibhanakuta accommpanied bybodhisattvas,and their teachings never appear in the other parts. it is therefore safe to say that thereis clearly continuity between chs.

Futthermore, ch. i unfolds with the 25bodhisattvasseverally expressing their ideas about *sarvaina, the style of which is widely found inother mahayana sutras, such as the vimalakirtinirdesa, ch. viiadvayadharmamukha-pravesanaparivarta'. Therefore it seems more reasonable to suppose that chs. i and ii wereappended under the influence of the other Mahayana sutras12).*This paper is based on the presentation entitled a study of the compilation of the akv with
