1.introductionharivamsaVdepicted visnu who was born as a human being krsna, and krsna killsa wicked king kamsa. besides this krsna stoty in the hv, various other stories are con-tained. the hvin the critical editionvconsists of118chapters. itis told that, hvis a supplement of the great indian epic hahcbharata [mh], on the other hand, it is toldas a kind of puranas, which is a group of literature on hindu myths and legends. kirfel19271showed that hv has great many coinmon verses withpuranas.The author of hvis said to be vyasa, a legendaty saint. in vulgata-versionvconsistsof approximately sixteen thousand verses. because the contents of Hv are very complicat-ed, such an incoherent story could not be made by one person. it is said that many authorsand editors took long time to make the book.In this paper, first i will show two previous important studies about the formation pro-cess of hv, then i will examine the idea of brinkhaus from the brahmapurona thatHv chapter 23.121was formerly linked with Hv chapter114.2.The previous research on the formationprocessThere are two kinds of previous research about the formation process ofHv. one showsthat the core of Hv lies iuramic elements inv. and other shows that the core of hvlies in krsna story itself.vaidya considers chapter 20-98th in hvcE)as the original hv. That is to say, he considers the krsna story as the central partof Hv, and this part was made as a supplement of〓h2
against vaidya's view, brinkhaus has a quite different view on the formation process ofHv. he considers chapter 1-10th, 20-23rd and114th as the original hv. according to his
The  uapanese sSociationofIndian and buddhistStudiesopinion, puranic elements inv were correlated with the mbh, and because the geneal-ogy of krsna dealt with in the purunic elements in v, this puronic part had already beenknown as hvbefore the krsna story was added3)3.The problem about parvasamgrahaparvnin mbhnexti will pick up the problem about parvasamgrahaparvanin mBh, which is very im-portant for researchers analyzitg about the fotmation process of hv. parvasamgrahapcy-van is the name of a chapter in mbh. it contains not only a survey of whole mbh contentsbut also hv. There are two passages about hv. These two passages are as followed.<sanskrit)
harivamsas tatah parva puranam khilasamjnitam/ohavisyatparva capy uktam khilesv evadbhutam mahat  mh1.6astadasaivaitani parvany uktany asesatah/【hilesu harivamsas ca bhavisyac ca prakirtitammbh1.2.23三<Translation)The appendix ofthe genealogy ofhari, andthe great wondrous book ofthe fnture, among the appendixesThis sums up all the eighteen books.In these two passages, the supplement of mbhis shown as the topics of the genealogy ofhari and the future. we should be careful that in which part ofhvcE corresponds to thesetwo topics. it can be guessed as followed. when this parvasamgrahaparvan was created,the topics of the genealogy of hHari and the future only existed as a supplement of the mbh.That is to say, in that time krsna story was not contained in the supplement of Mbh, andKrsna story was added to hv later.imong the appendixes are mentioned The genealogy ofhari and the book ofthe funure4.Thelink betweenv23andhv114Here, i will show the link between hv3and hv114, and explain the meaning in thefonnation process of HTv. brinkhaus considered chapter 1-10,-23.121, and chapter 114as the originalhv. he examined the contents ofHV and statedhv23.121was linked afterHTV chapter 11nd various stories were inserted between them.The content of Hv chapter 23is the genealogy of puru).before hv23.121.narrator
The uapanese asSociationofIndian and buddhiStStudiestells the genealogy of the characters who have some connection with mbh. at the last partof hv chapter 23,the genealogy of Yadu, in which there is a relation to krsna, is told. Thedescription of the genealogy finishes at hv chapter 29, and after hTv chapter29 there is nodescription of the genealogy up to the genealogy of janamejayaiv chapter114.beforehv23.121the genealogy up to the father of Janameijaya is told, but there is no descriptionof janamejaya inhv3.That is toldinv114. Therefore, the description of the geneal-ogy iv chapter 23was formerly linked with the description of the genealogy invchapter 114. itis possible to assume that these two chapters were cut sometime at the stageof the forming process and after that the present structure hv chapter 23and hv chapter114was completed.Iwill quote the two passages in arow, hv23.121andhv114.2, intentto show the evi-dence that this hv23.121and the subsequent hTv114.2were a series of texts.〓

Therefore, in terms of the contents, ican conclude that hv23.121andhv114-18were formerly linked.5.hv23andv1i terms of 'narrative framework〓Imbh. Suta ugrasravas comes to the saints, who performs a Sattra rite for twelve years
The japaneSe asSociation ofIndian and buddhiSt Studiesin naimisa forest, and tells the mbh story. moreoverin the "narrative framework〓 betweenugrasravas and saint Saunaka, there are another "narrative framework' of vaisampayanaand king janamejaya. in this "narrative framework", janamejaya who is great-grandchildof arjuna performs a sarpasattra and during this rite vaisampayana tells a various holystories in front of the king janamnejaya.The "narrative stage' iv has also almost the same form,figure l. The narrative stage inv2b. vyasaxJanamejayav115.11-117.1)although the mBh story is already told by suta ugrasravas, saunaka asks suta ugras-ravas to tell the story, which was not told in mbh. this situation is told in the beginningof Hv. suta ugrasravas said after vaisamnpayana recited mbh, Janamejaya asked vaisam-payana, as like saunaka did, to tell the genealogy of vrsni heroesFigure 〓shows the "narrative framnework" iv.First stage

These setting of hv chapter 3and mbh are the same. but this settingcontinues tillv131,after fromv chapter 115another setting begins, where vyasatells Janamenaya another story. inhV chapter 114, only one "narrative framework" is set,where ugrasravas tells Saunaka a storv.5.comparison with brahmapurana1
The uapanese asSociationofIndian and buddhiStStudiesNow i give bp chapter 13as an example of hv23.121linked with Hv1142-18.pchapter 13ad hv chapter 23,chapter 114have many parallel passages. although the"narrative framework' is different〓 , the contents of the story is almost the same. itis defi-nite that there is a text which v231-123.122are told orderly.7.conclusion
〓n bp chapter 13, after the passages that cotrespond to the passage hv23.121,hv114.2-18is told. Then the passages that correspond to the passages fromv23.122aretold. hence when we examine the felationship with puranas, we ca conclude that althoughHv23.121and the passages fromv114.2was a series of texts. these texts were dividedinto two in a certain phase during forming process inv and between these two, krsnastory was inserted. as a resultpresent structure ofhv was made.bibliography
